%************************************************

In order to control the SALS model of mind, a mind monitoring
application called \emph{MindMon} has been implemented.  MindMon is
based on abstract physical world and reflective thinking components
that allow reflective thinking layers to be interchanged with
different $\text{reflective}^0$ physical layers.  In this dissertation
I focus on a block building domain in order to demonstrate
second-order reflective learning to plan, but other more complex
physical domains have also been developed within SALS such as the
IsisWorld physical simulator described by \cite{smith:2010}, where
MindMon allows attaching multiple reflective thinking models to a
shared $\text{reflective}^0$ physical layer, a type of simulation that
assumes a more complex subjective philosophy of mind that is not
assumed in the non-subjective model described in
{\mbox{\autoref{part:the_model}}} of this thesis.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:implemented_mindmon}}} shows the implemented
MindMon application.

\section{The Physical Knowledge-Base}

The block building domain is a simulation based on two-dimensional
ridid-body physical laws, including floating point numerical
representations for object positions, velocities and accellerations.
These numerical representations and the processes that manipulate them
are part of the $\text{reflective}^0$ physical layer of the model, but
in order to focus the efficiency of the procedural reflection, a much
simpler relational graph representation has been specifically
represented in semantic frame-based objects in a semantic
knowledge-base, referred to as the \emph{physical knowledge-base}.
The physical knowledge-base includes objects with shapes, colors, and
multiple prepositional spatial relationships.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:implemented_physical_knowledge}}} shows the
