\noindent I would like to thank my committee:
Joe Paradiso for his belief in my ability,
Marvin Minsky for consistently providing critical perspective and important areas for research,
Gerry Sussman for teaching a love of programming, and
Mike Cox for leading in the space of metacognitive AI.

\noindent I would like to thank my immediate family:
Greg Morgan and Carolyn Spinner for being willing to help me think about anything at any time.
Paul Bergman for teaching me how to program.
Virginia Barasch for making it a party.
Leaf Morgan for playing Archon.

Dustin Smith for the physical social commonsense kitchen simulation.
Radu Raduta for the PID control loops for robot balance and movement.
Jon Spaulding for the EEG amplifiers and pasteless electrodes.
Gleb Kuznetsov for the first version of a 3D commonsense kitchen critic-selector layout planner.
Jing Jian for being so good at finding critical bugs in Funk2 and for writing all of the learned-reactive resources for following recipes in the kitchen.
Panupong Pasupat for the error-correcting subgraph isomorphism algorithm and the Winston difference-of-difference analogy algorithm.
Mika Braginsky for the visualization of mental resources, agencies, and layers.

\noindent I would be remiss if I were not to thank, again in some cases, the following individuals,
whom have kept me laughing through the PhD process:
Dustin Smith, % for being a rock.

Josh Lifton, % for inspiring me to write my first garbage collector and ultimately my own programming language.
Mat Laibowitz, % for disagreeing with me about almost everything, being the hardest-core engineer, and refusing ``to party''.
Mark Feldmeier, % for being there to ask questions, listen, and talk.
Matt Aldrich, % for jamming, teaching me about metal, learning technically intricate music.
Nan-Wei Gong, % for singing, playing keys, and generally rocking out.
Mike Lapinski, % for being a healthy athlete.
Nan Zhao, % for dancing and playing music.
Clio Andris, % for going through the sometimes painful PhD process with me.
Hannah Perner-Wilson, % for discussing the limitations of categorical thinking.
