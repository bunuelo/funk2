annote = {Statistical framework (little, Rubin 87):
a) environment - generates complete data
b) missing data mechanism - renders some of the output of the environment to the learner.

supervised learning: form a map from inputs to targets
unsupervised learning: extacting some compact statistical description of the inputs.  

both benefit from knowing the constraints on the generation (e.g., a parameteric family) and the mechanism which caused the pattern of incompleteness (independent etc).

title = {The acute effects of cannabinoids on memory in humans: a review.},
abstract = {RATIONALE: Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most robust effects on short-term episodic and working memory in humans. A large body of the work in this area occurred in the 1970s before the discovery of cannabinoid receptors. Recent advances in the knowledge of cannabinoid receptors' function have rekindled interest in examining effects of exogenous cannabinoids on memory and in understanding the mechanism of these effects. OBJECTIVE: The literature about the acute effects of cannabinoids on memory tasks in humans is reviewed. The limitations of the human literature including issues of dose, route of administration, small sample sizes, sample selection, effects of other drug use, tolerance and dependence to cannabinoids, and the timing and sensitivity of psychological tests are discussed. Finally, the human literature is discussed against the backdrop of preclinical findings. RESULTS: Acute administration of Delta-9-THC transiently impairs immediate and delayed free recall of information presented after, but not before, drug administration in a dose- and delay-dependent manner. In particular, cannabinoids increase intrusion errors. These effects are more robust with the inhaled and intravenous route and correspond to peak drug levels. CONCLUSIONS: This profile of effects suggests that cannabinoids impair all stages of memory including encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Several mechanisms, including effects on long-term potentiation and long-term depression and the inhibition of neurotransmitter (GABA, glutamate, acetyl choline, dopamine) release, have been implicated in the amnestic effects of cannabinoids. Future research in humans is necessary to characterize the neuroanatomical and neurochemical basis of the memory impairing effects of cannabinoids, to dissect out their effects on the various stages of memory and to bridge the expanding gap between the humans and preclinical literature.},

In this study, subjects read brief narratives describing everyday activities while brain activity was recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects later read the stories again to divide them into large and small events. During the initial reading, points later identified as boundaries between events were associated with transient increases in activity in a number of brain regions whose activity was mediated by changes in the narrated situation, such as changes in characters' goals. These results indicate that the segmentation of narrated activities into events is a spontaneous part of reading, and that this process of segmentation is likely dependent on neural responses to changes in the narrated situation.},

title = {Alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review of published studies},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) has emerged as a lesser invasive alternative to surgical myectomy over the past decade. The purpose of this study is to analyze all the published literature on outcomes and complications after ASA. METHODS: MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for all available published literature on ASA (June 1996-June 2005) using the terms hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, alcohol septal ablation for HOCM, alcohol septal ablation (ASA), transcoronary alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (TASH), transcoronary alcohol septal ablation for HOCM, nonsurgical septal reduction therapy (NSRT), and percutaneous transcoronary septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA). RESULTS: A total of 42 published studies (2,959 patients) were analyzed. Mean age was 53.5 (35.4-72) years with a mean male to female ratio of 1.17. Mean follow-up was 12.7 +/- 0.3 months (1.5-43.2). Absolute ethanol (3 mL) was injected in 1.2 septal perforator arteries. On average, serum CK peaked at 964 units. At 12 months, there was a sustained decrease in resting and provoked LVOT gradient (65.3-15.8 and 125.4-31.5 mmHg, respectively) accompanied by reduction in basal septal diameter (20.9-13.9 mm), improvement in NYHA Class (2.9-1.2), and increase in exercise capacity (325.3-437.5 seconds). Early mortality (within 30 days) was 1.5% (0.0-5.0%) and late mortality (beyond 30 days) was 0.5% (0.0-9.3%). Other complications include ventricular fibrillation (2.2%), LAD dissection (1.8%), complete heart block requiring permanent pacemaker (10.5%), and pericardial effusion (0.6%). A repeat ASA was performed on 6.6% of patients and 1.9% of patients underwent surgical myomectomy with resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Literature to date suggests that ASA results in acute and intermediate-term favorable clinical and echocardiographic outcomes. A randomized controlled trial is needed to compare ASA and myomectomy in order to determine which technique provides maximal benefit.},

@article{Jackendoff:1991p2894,
author = {R Jackendoff}, 
journal = {Cognition},
title = {Parts and boundaries},
abstract = {Within the framework of Conceptual Semantics, a family of conceptual features and functions is developed that accounts for phenomena in the semantics of noun phrases such as the mass-count distinction, plurality, the partitive construction (a leg of the table), the constitutive construction (a house of wood), the "Universal Packager" (three coffees), and boundary words such as end, edge, and crust. Using the strong formal parallelism between noun phrase semantics and event structure that is a hallmark of the Conceptual Semantics approach, the features and functions of the NP system are applied to a wide range of problems in event structure, for example the analysis of the Vendler classes, the meaning of the progressive, the "imperfective paradox", and "aktionsarten" such as the syntactically unexpressed sense of repetition in The light flashed until dawn. Crucial to the analysis is that these features and functions can be expressed in syntactic structure either by being part of lexical conceptual structure, or by use of a morphological affix, or by being associated with the meaning of a construction such as N of NP or nominal compounding. Alternatively, they may remain unexpressed altogether, being introduced into the conceptual structure of a phrase by "rules of construal". This shows that lexical semantics and phrasal semantics interpenetrate deeply, and that there is no strict one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and semantic structures. In addition, the analysis provides further evidence that natural language semantics must be based on a psychological view of meaning--it must be concerned with how language users are constructed to understand and schematize the world.},

Changes from Proposal to Thesis
- name
-

- understand which information may be useful wtihin their current local contax.

proactivity, non-intrusive, attention to local context.



Not distract the user
- same presentation as the task if the information is similar (different if different) 
 (how does this work?)
 - 'ramping interface', gradually show more information 

- retrieved information is  evaluated by utility
 - "cognitive science" way of looking at precision (retrieved relevant  of the retrieved)


Rememberance Agent
=================
- extension to Emacs,  retrieves a list of related documents sorted by their word co-occurance

Margin Notes
==========
- web browser

Jimminy
======
- wearable note taker / RA and head-mounted display
- context (kewords, physical environment)



RA, Jimminity, and Margin notes are 'front ends' to Savant, th IR system.

Front end: detect local context and send queries to Savant, which returns a ranked list.

Savant
======
- template matching system that can recognize differen types of documents or queries and index them automateically.  
- e.g., emails = [Subject, Author, Date and Body]


Similarity metrics for each data type:
	- dates = number of days between them (on a  log distance from current day?)
	- location = based on GPS coordinates, (Crabtree from BT)


Indexing:
	- regular expressions that filter extraneous / junk data




Theory - How does a JITIR affect the way a person aseeks out and uses information? 

- obscure dfeinition of intelligence, which is more like "problem solving ability" which thus also includes the tools used by the user.

journal = {AI Encyclopedia},
title = {Clustering},
annote = {Clustering;

	A process of grouping objects into classes of similar objects.
	
	Based on predfined measures of simlarity:
		- attributes are considered as dimensions of a multidimensional description sace, where each object correspondes to a point in the space.  The similarity between objects can be measured as a reciprocal function of the distance between the points in the description space.

	 - interpretation of the meaning of these clusters is left to the data analysis.
	
Developing category descriptions.
	Instead: induce category descriptions from examples.

	Clusters generated solely on the basis of some predefined numerical measure of simlarity may in principle lack simple conceptual explanations.
	- Similarity measures typically consider all attributes with equal importance and make no distinctions between relevance.
	
	Weights don't work well because there are no mechanisms for:
	1. selecting and evaluating attributes in the process of generating lusters.  
	2. no mechanism for automatically constructing new attributes that may be more adequate for clustering than those initially provided.
 		- they are given a priori by the researcher and sometimes they don't make sense.
		- if there are hidden dependencies between the weights.


	- And other things of background knowledge that are usually done after the clustering.  Such as convering features into larger representations that are more important features (picking out two letters from strings of dots forming S and M)

How do humans cluster objects?
	 - people search for one or more attributes out of many candidates that are most relevant to the goal of clustering and on that basis cluster the bojects..

Objects are put to the same cluster if they score simlarlly on these attributes.

A description of the objects in teh same cluster can be expressed as a single statement or a conjunction of statements each specifying one common property (attribute value) of the objects in the cluster.  

individual statements (clusters) may contain disjunctions


conceptual clustering tries to overcome these problems.  with the premise that objects should be arranged in classes that represent simple concepts and are useful from the viewpoint of the goal of the clustering.  Thus objects in the same cluster do not necessary have to be similar in any mathematically defined sense but must as a group represent the same concept.   The notion of similarity must be replaced by a more general notion of conceptual cohesiveness. 

Conceptual cohesiveness between two objects A and B depends on the attributes of these objects, the attribute of nearby objets, and the set of concepts available fro describing object configurations.

Michalski adds two parts to the similarity/distance function; the environment and the set of available concepts (background knowledge).

A goal-=dependency network (1986- Conceptual Clustering: Inventing goal-oriented classifications of structured objects) can be used to indicate which attributes are relevant to which goals of classification.

Classifiying clustering problems on the basis of the deminsionality of objects to be clustered:

1. 1-d clustering (quantization of variables).   Identifying equivalence classes of values to reduce the number of distinct values.  These clusters are then treated as single units. 
	- Scanners usually disinguish between a large number of gray levels, but only a few levels may be needed for solving a given problem. 
	- Nubuyaski made an algorithm in which the clusters have a minimal sums of squares of intracluster distances. 


2. 2-d clustering (segmentation).  k-means algorthm (MacQueen)

3. multidimensional clustering.  Objectsa are partitioned into clustering in a description space spanned by man attributes characterizing the objects. 
	- assume different geometric distributions of the pionts in space by the different normalization, transformation, and statistical treatments of the attributes.

Ref 13.  A sumary of various distance measures

A: Agglomerative techniques -  often used in numerical taxonomy.  form clusters by progressive fasion, recursively joining separate entities and small groups together to form larger and larger groupings.   Eventually a single universal group is formed and teh process halts, leaving a record of the merges.  That hisory of merges is often displayed as a dendogram. 

The complete dendogram may be 'cut' apart across some similarity boundary, yeilding an humber of clusters.

During agglomerative clustering, it is necessary to calculate the similarities between groups of entities.  3 standard ways to calculate between-group similarities (reciprocal of distances)

Groups X and Y:
	1. single-linkage methods: calculate btw group distance between one entity in the group X and Y
	2. complete linkage; maximum distance between one entity in group X and another in group Y
	3. average -

B: Diversive Techniques: form a classification by progressive sub-division: repeatedly breaking the initial set into smaller and smaller clusers until only single entities exist.  The result is a hierarchy of clusters.

title = {Intersensory redundancy guides attentional selectivity and perceptual learning in infancy.},
abstract = {This study assessed an intersensory redundancy hypothesis, which holds that in early infancy information presented redundantly and in temporal synchrony across two sense modalities selectively recruits attention and facilitates perceptual differentiation more effectively than does the same information presented unimodally. Five-month-old infants' sensitivity to the amodal property of rhythm was examined in 3 experiments. Results revealed that habituation to a bimodal (auditory and visual) rhythm resulted in discrimination of a novel rhythm, whereas habituation to the same rhythm presented unimodally (auditory or visual) resulted in no evidence of discrimination. Also, temporal synchrony between the bimodal auditory and visual information was necessary for rhythm discrimination. These findings support an intersensory redundancy hypothesis and provide further evidence for the importance of redundancy for guiding and constraining early perceptual learning.},

title = {Systematicity as a Selection Constraint in Analogical Mapping},
abstract = {In an analogy, a familiar domain is used to understand a novel domain in order to highlight important similarities between the domains, or to predict new features of the novel domain. For example, we use our knowledge about water },
annote = {Analogy: Using background knowledge about one 'domain' to understand a second domain, by highlighting impofrtant similarities betweeen domains or to predict new features of teh second domain.

A central problem in theories of analogical mappaing is to identify the selectional constraints that tell us which similarities and dissimilarities to count in an analogy.

1) goal-relevance constraints:  direct analogical mapping toward information that is relevant to the problem at hand
2) structural constraints:  properties of the matching information as structural consistency. 

	In Gentners theory:  First people seek to map relations between objects than non-relational object attributes.  Second, people use a systematicity principle: they seek to map relations that participate in a system of relations governed by higher-order relations (e.g. causal relations) that can also be mapped between the two domains.

Aspects of analogical mapping:  matching (existing information in the base and target domains) and carry over (new information from the base to the target)

Are both governed by the same selection principles?

title = {Immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.},
abstract = {The absence of curative therapies for advanced or recurrent forms of prostate cancer mandates continued development of novel, more effective treatment regimens. Due to recent advances in basic and translational research, therapeutic vaccines and monoclonal antibody-based therapies are steadily gaining ground as promising treatment modalities against prostate cancer. Several immunotherapeutic products have recently been investigated in later-phase trials and have reported evidence for clinical benefit while maintaining an excellent quality of life for participants. The cumulative clinical results available to date indicate that immune-based therapies will likely play a role in the treatment of patients with prostate and other malignancies. The objective of this article is to increase awareness of contemporary immunologic therapies and clinical trials of new biologic reagents against prostate cancer. We also seek to encourage urologists to actively participate in clinical trials and evaluate the potential of immunotherapeutic drugs for impacting standards of care.},

@article{Cheng:1991p2649,
author = {P W Cheng and L R Novick}, 
journal = {Cognition},
title = {Causes versus enabling conditions},
abstract = {People distinguish between a cause (e.g., a malfunctioning component in an airplane causing it to crash) and a condition (e.g., gravity) that merely enables the cause to yield its effect. This distinction cannot be explained by accounts of reasoning formulated purely in terms of necessity and sufficiency, because causes and enabling conditions hold the same logical relationship to the effect in those terms. Proposals to account for this apparent deviation from accounts based on necessity and sufficiency may be classified into three types. One approach explains the distinction in terms of an inferential rule based on the normality of the potential causal factors. Another approach explains the distinction in terms of the conversational principle of being informative to the inquirer given assumptions about his or her state of knowledge. The present paper evaluates variants of these two approaches, and presents our probabilistic contrast model, which takes a third approach. This approach explains the distinction between causes and enabling conditions by the covariation between potential causes and the effect in question over a focal set--a set of events implied by the context. Covariation is defined probabilistically, with necessity and sufficiency as extreme cases of the components defining contrasts. We report two experiments testing our model against variants of the normality and conversational views.},

title = {Emotion and consciousness.},
abstract = {Consciousness and emotion feature prominently in our personal lives, yet remain enigmatic. Recent advances prompt further distinctions that should provide more experimental traction: we argue that emotion consists of an emotion state (functional aspects, including emotional response) as well as feelings (the conscious experience of the emotion), and that consciousness consists of level (e.g. coma, vegetative state and wakefulness) and content (what it is we are conscious of). Not only is consciousness important to aspects of emotion but structures that are important for emotion, such as brainstem nuclei and midline cortices, overlap with structures that regulate the level of consciousness. The intersection of consciousness and emotion is ripe for experimental investigation, and we outline possible examples for future studies.},

title = {The emergence of a shared action ontology: building blocks for a theory},
abstract = {To have an ontology is to interpret a world. In this paper we argue that the brain, viewed as a representational system aimed at interpreting our world, possesses an ontology too. It creates primitives and makes existence assumptions. It decomposes target space in a way that exhibits a certain invariance, which in turn is functionally significant. We will investigate which are the functional regularities guiding this decomposition process, by answering to the following questions: What are the explicit and implicit assumptions about the structure of reality, which at the same time shape the causal profile of the brain's motor output and its representational deep structure, in particular of the conscious mind arising from it (its "phenomenal output")? How do they constrain high-level phenomena like conscious experience, the emergence of a first-person perspective, or social cognition? By reviewing a series of neuroscientific results and integrating them with a wider philosophical perspective, we will emphasize the contribution the motor system makes to this process. As it will be shown, the motor system constructs goals, actions, and intending selves as basic constituents of the world it interprets. It does so by assigning a single, unified causal role to them. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the brain models movements and action goals in terms of multimodal representations of organism-object-relations. Under a representationalist analysis, this process can be conceived of as an internal, dynamic representation of the intentionality-relation itself. We will show how such a complex form of representational content, once it is in place, can later function as a functional building block for social cognition and for a more complex, consciously experienced representation of the first-person perspective as well.},

It offers invaluable tools for theoretical analyses and exploration of the structure of sentences, texts, dialogues, and speech. We report here the results of an attempt at using it for inspecting sequences of verbs from French accounts of road accidents. This analysis comes from an original approach of unsupervised training allowing the discovery of the structure of sequential data. The entries of the analyzer were only made of the verbs appearing in the sentences. It provided a classification of the links between two successive verbs into four distinct clusters, allowing thus text segmentation. We give here an interpretation of these clusters by applying a statistical analysis to independent semantic annotations.},

title = {Concept Formation by Incremental Analogical Reasoning and Debugging},
abstract = {Mark H. Burstein},
annote = {CARL, learns about the semantics of assignment statements when given analogies like those found in basic computer programming textbooks.

Models of Analogy developed around forms of partial-pattern matching 	- Evans (1968),  Winston (1980)
	- based on the assumption that the best partial match could be found by accumulating evidence for each of a number of possible object-to-object mappings between representation sof two situations and then chosing the one that scored highest.

	- draw backs:
1. presuppses well-defined representational models of the situations in the base and target domains are available as inputs.
	in learning situation, the required prior representations of objects/relations in the target domain may be wrong or inconsistent with the analogy.
	

The point of presentation of an alaogy to students is to aid them in the *construction* of a representation of a target situation or to correct problems in a prior representation. 
	- Matching cannot be used to construct such a representation where there was none before.

2.  as the complexity of the descriptions increases, conceptual representations for real situations may contain many objects that don't take part in a specified analogy. 

it must be possible to find analogical relationships between situations without pairing detailed specifications of all of the objects potentially present in representations of each situations.

systematicity condition:
(Gentner and Gentner, 1982)  -- "predicates are more likely to be imported into the target if they belong to a system of coherent, mutually constraining relationships, the others of which are mapped"

annote = {Clustering is a type of Inductive Learning

Conceptual clustering; grouping objects into conceptually simple classes.
	- classifying objects represented by structural descriprionts rather than sequences of attribute value
	
For meaningful classification, a system must be equipped with background knowledge;
	1. goals of classifciation
	2. classification evaluation criteria
	3. deductive and inductive inference rules

The goals and goal-relevant descriptive concepts are organized into a goal-dependency network (GDN)

Inference rules permit the system to derive hihg-level descriptive concepts such as functional and causal attributes from lower-level descriptiive concepts provided intiially.

CLUSTER/S

Classification is the first step in develoing a theory about a collection of observations.  Known as learning from observation, without a teacher, where the goal is to structure given observations into a hierarchy of meaningful categories.

Past work is done on the mathematical measure of similarity between objects, defined over a fininite, a priori given set of object attributes.

These methods assume the objects are characterized by sequences of attribut/value pairs and that this is sufficient to creating a classification. 
	- do not take into account background knowledge about the semantic relationsh about object attributes or global concepts.
	- do not take into account the goals of classification that may be indiicated by background knowledge.

annote = {- Learning sometimes requires creating new representations that are more powerful than those available at the onset (Bootstrapping).

- What is the origin of concepts?    Concepts are individuated on the basis of 1) their reference to different entities in the world, and 2) their role in distinct mental systems of inferential relations.  (DS: 2 subsumes 1)

- How do humans acquire concepts?  1. What are the building blocks (conceptual primitives)?
2.  How are the learned concepts different from these innate conceptual primitives?
3. How do the learning mechanisms work?

- Infants acquire several representations with numerical content before language:
1.  Mental symbols that are neural magnitudes linearly related to the number of individuals in a set ("The Number sense" book), with comparision, difference, addition and subtraction as operators.

- Weber's law: discriminability is a function of the absolute numerical value. 

- Infants and animals form analog magnitude representations of large sets. Analog magnitude representations are not as powerful as integers.

- 10-14mo infants see 3 objects placed into a box sequentially.  They are allowed to retrieve them, and the children expect exactly 3.  Performance breaks down at 4 objects.  

- Children first learn "one" as relative to "more than one"

title = {Temporal construal},
abstract = {Construal level theory proposes that temporal distance changes people's responses to future events by changing the way people mentally represent those events. The greater the temporal distance, the more likely are events to be represented in terms of a few abstract features that convey the perceived essence of the events (high-level construals) rather than in terms of more concrete and incidental details of the events (low-level construals). The informational and evaluative implications of high-level construals, compared with those of low-level construals, should therefore have more impact on responses to distant-future events than near-future events. This article explores the implications of construal level theory for temporal changes in evaluation, prediction, and choice. The authors suggest that construal level underlies a broad range of evaluative and behavioral consequences of psychological distance from events.},

abstract = {In 3 studies, the authors explored the relation between threatening upward social comparisons and performance. In an initial study, participants were exposed to comparison targets who either threatened or boosted self-evaluations and then completed a performance task. Participants exposed to the threatening target performed better than those in a control group, whereas those exposed to the nonthreatening target performed worse. In Study 2, self-affirmation prior to comparison with threatening targets eliminated performance improvements. In Study 3, performance improvements were found only when the performance domain was different from the domain of success of the comparison target. These boundary conditions suggest that increases in performance following social comparison arise from individuals' motivations to maintain and repair self-evaluations. Implications for the study of the behavioral consequences of social comparison are discussed.},

title = {Covariation in natural causal induction},
abstract = {The covariation component of everyday causal inference has been depicted, in both cognitive and social psychology as well as in philosophy, as heterogeneous and prone to biases. The models and biases discussed in these domains are analyzed with respect to focal sets: contextually determined sets of events over which covariation is computed. Moreover, these models are compared to our probabilistic contrast model, which specifies causes as first and higher order contrasts computed over events in a focal set. Contrary to the previous depiction of covariation computation, the present assessment indicates that a single normative mechanism--the computation of probabilistic contrasts--underlies this essential component of natural causal induction both in everyday and in scientific situations.},

title = {Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension},
abstract = {Observing actions and understanding sentences about actions activates corresponding motor processes in the observer-comprehender. In 5 experiments, the authors addressed 2 novel questions regarding language-based motor resonance. The 1st question asks whether visual motion that is associated with an action produces motor resonance in sentence comprehension. The 2nd question asks whether motor resonance is modulated during sentence comprehension. The authors' experiments provide an affirmative response to both questions. A rotating visual stimulus affects both actual manual rotation and the comprehension of manual rotation sentences. Motor resonance is modulated by the linguistic input and is a rather immediate and localized phenomenon. The results are discussed in the context of theories of action observation and mental simulation.},

annote = {Benefits of goal-setting


By breaking down the achievement of goals into sub-tasks which can be persued in isolations, it helps the individual achieve the higher-level goals when they have to .


An analogy of packet size with interput messages.   Trade off, as messages get too long, the likelihood of an interrpution increases, causing serious problems such as understanding where to resume and possibility requiring restarting (as in the case of a network message).

Also, sub-goals with specific times and clearly defined actions are more useful for deliberative processes (planning) than vague and ambitious 

Direct interpretation of information, giving the person "tunnel vision"  (Locke {\&} Latham 1990)


Prospect theory (Health 1999)
Goals for a frame of reference from which people evaluate their sucess or failure.

Treating goals as a utility function.    The easier to acess the function, the more likely they will be able to acheive them.
- dividing the space into gains or losses (binary outcomes) / success or failure
- losess are more painful than goals

- Sigmodial curve where middle is the threshold between acheivement, versus log function of diminishing marginal utilikty


"do your best goals"  (not as effective) resemble the standard model of diminising marginal utiltiy, whereby each additional increment in performance yields an increasingly smaller harvest in satisfaction.
	- fail to discriminate between the rewards of easily acessible versus more repmote demanding reaigions of accomplsihment.

abstract = {Decrements in performance on cognitive tasks resulting from pressure to perform (i.e., choking) are thought to be caused by interference with the ability to use explicit strategies (the distraction theory). This view suggests that pressure should improve performance on tasks for which explicit strategies hamper performance. This hypothesis was tested by giving subjects one of two nearly identical learning tasks, a task that required learning a rule or one that required using a holistic information-integration strategy. Explicit rule use would hurt performance in the latter task. As predicted by the distraction theory, pressure decreased performance on the rule-based task but enhanced performance on the information-integration task.},

- Self-Repair (necessitates self-model)



When developing components/function, the system engineer needs to establishing interfaces that allow the interconnection of components so that the functions of those components can be combined to build compound functions.

Standarization


Human Genome is 1GByte

Redundant mechanism has more parts than an equivalent non-redundant mechanism.

A degenerate mechanism appears more extravagant.

Range of outputs should be much smaller than the range of acceptable inputs.  Anaalogous to the static dicipline in the digital abstraction in computers science.

Digital abstraction's power comes from that the outputs are always better than the acceptable inputs, so it suppresses noise.

abstract = {People often fail to retrieve examples analogous to a current problem or situation. There is good evidence that comparing structurally matching cases facilitates subsequent analogical access. However, current approaches offer little at the time of memory search to promote retrieval of a routinely encoded analogous source. We adapted Gick and Holyoak's (1980, 1983) classic paradigm to investigate whether comparing two unsolved problems at test promotes retrieval of a single previously studied analogue. In Experiment 1, comparison of test problems facilitated analogical problem solving. Experiment 2 showed that comparison is the critical factor since solving two test problems separately proved ineffective. In Experiment 3, comparing two problems led to greater success for participants who read a prior analogous story than those who did not, demonstrating specifically that comparison facilitates retrieval. The three studies show that analogical access is powerfully determined by problem encoding. Implications for psychological theory and real-world applications are discussed.},

Over the past decade, a large body of work, spanning most of the neurosciences, has provided a substantive body of evidence supporting this role of sleep in what is becoming known as sleep-dependent memory processing. We review these findings, focusing specifically on the role of sleep in (a) memory encoding, (b) memory consolidation, (c) brain plasticity, and (d) memory reconsolidation; we finish with a summary of the field and its potential future directions.},

abstract = {According to Zwaan, Langston, and Graesser's (1995) event-indexing model, when comprehending text, readers monitor changes in a series of critical dimensions: space, time, protagonist, causality, and intentionality. In this study, the influence of dimensional focus was assessed during situation-model construction. Participants read narratives and were instructed to specifically monitor a single dimension while their sentence reading times were recorded. Critical sentence reading times were then analyzed for all shift types. Results support the general prediction that at least the time and protagonist dimensions are resistant to task demands, demonstrating that comprehenders routinely perform dimensional updating processes that are context independent. These results are discussed in the context of the event-indexing model.},

title = {Contextual conditioning in infants, but not older animals, is facilitated by CS conditioning.},
abstract = {Context conditioning in infant Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal days [PD] 15, 17, and 19), juveniles (PD 25), adolescents (PD 35), and adults (PD 71-89) was compared when CS conditioning did or did not occur in the context. Degree of CS conditioning within that context was equated across age, and separate groups at each age were given unpaired presentations of the CS and US within that context. Infants conditioned more effectively to context when CS-US pairings occurred in that context than when they did not, juveniles conditioned to context about equally with and without CS-US pairings in the context, and adolescents and adults conditioned less effectively to context when CS and US were paired than when unpaired. Adolescents had significant context conditioning despite CS-US pairings in the context but adults did not, and overall, context conditioning was strongest for adolescents. Supplementary experiments indicated that with more extensive conditioning experience, the infants' pattern of context conditioning became more similar to that of older animals, and with less conditioning experience the pattern of context conditioning by adults became more similar to that of younger animals, but infants never attained the adult pattern of context conditioning nor did adults attain the infant pattern. The potentiation of context conditioning by CS conditioning observed in infants is consistent with previous evidence derived from compound conditioning. Alternative explanations place common emphasis on infant-specific amodal processing. One views potentiation as a result of the greater perceived intensity of the stimulus compound (CS and context, in this case) during conditioning and the lesser generalization decrement in infants than adults when tested with a single element after conditioning with a compound. The other explanation emphasizes consequences of the redundancy inherent in intersensory compounds, within the theory of Bahrick and Lickliter.},

title = {Event perception: a mind-brain perspective},
abstract = {People perceive and conceive of activity in terms of discrete events. Here the authors propose a theory according to which the perception of boundaries between events arises from ongoing perceptual processing and regulates attention and memory. Perceptual systems continuously make predictions about what will happen next. When transient errors in predictions arise, an event boundary is perceived. According to the theory, the perception of events depends on both sensory cues and knowledge structures that represent previously learned information about event parts and inferences about actors' goals and plans. Neurological and neurophysiological data suggest that representations of events may be implemented by structures in the lateral prefrontal cortex and that perceptual prediction error is calculated and evaluated by a processing pathway, including the anterior cingulate cortex and subcortical neuromodulatory systems.},

title = {Goal-Directed Classification using Linear Machine Decision Trees},
abstract = {Recent work in feature-based classification has focused on non-parametric techniquesthat can classify instances even when the underlying feature distributions areunknown. The inference algorithms for training these techniques, however, are designedto maximize the accuracy of the classifier, with all errors weighted equally. In manyapplications, certain errors are far more costly than others, and the need arises fornon-parametric classification techniques that can be trained to optimize task-specificcost functions. This paper reviews the Linear Machine Decision Tree (LMDT) algorithmfor inducing multivariate decision trees, and shows how LMDT can be altered toinduce decision trees that minimize arbitrary misclassification cost functions (MCFs).Demonstrations of pixel classification in outdoor scenes show how MCFs can optimizethe performance of embedded classifiers within the context of larger image understandingsystems.Keywords: Decision Trees, Non-Parametric Classification, ...},

This chapter outlines an emerging scientific agenda for understanding what these experiences feel like and how they arise. We review the available answers to what is felt (i.e., the content that makes up an experience of emotion) and how neurobiological processes instantiate these properties of experience. These answers are then integrated into a broad framework that describes, in psychological terms, how the experience of emotion emerges from more basic processes. We then discuss the role of such experiences in the economy of the mind and behavior.},

abstract = {Two experiments investigate the role of similarity and causal-ecological knowledge in expert and novice categorization and reasoning. In Experiment 1, university undergraduates and commercial fishermen sorted marine creatures into groups; although there was substantial agreement, novices sorted largely on the basis of appearance, whereas experts often cited commercial, ecological, or behavioral factors, and systematically subdivided fish on the basis of ecological niche. In Experiment 2, experts and novices were asked to generalize a blank property or novel disease from a pair of marine creatures. Novices relied on similarity to guide generalizations. Experts used similarity to reason about blank properties but ecological relations to reason about diseases. Expertise appears to involve knowledge of multiple relations among entities and context-sensitive application of those relations.},

annote = {Cognitive architecture as representational assuptions, characteristics of memories,  the processes that operate on memories, and interfaces to perception and motor control.

Newell 1973 - "You can't play 20q w/ nature and win"
- instead of carrying out micro-studies that address only one issue at a time, we shuld try to unify many findings into a single theorectical framework.
- led to 'production systems'

SOAR
 - production rules - procedural long-term knowledge organized in terms of operateors w/ associated problem spaces.
- some operators describe simple primative actions that modify the agent's internal state or generate primitive external actions.

All tasks are forumlated as attempting to acheive goals.
	- Operators perform the basic deliberative acts of the system (using background knowledge to determine their selection and application.

Processing cycle: Proposes, selects and applies operators of the current problem space to a problem state.

- with insufficient knowledge to pick an operator, or when one cannot be implemented, an impasse occrs.  Soar creates a new goal to determine which operator it should select and how it should implement the abstract operator.

** Error-based 'elevation'.  
** Different representations for different problems. 
** Mutiple 'ways-to-think' not just breaking them apart.


Leads to a dynamic generation of a goal hierarchy, where the problems are decomposed into subproblems as necssary.  The state of a specific goal includes all features of  its supergoals,

Subgoals can deliberatively access episodic or semantic memory to retrieve knowledge relevant to resolving the impasse.

*** Decoupling of episodic (history of previous states) and semantic memory (previously encountered facts) 

** Self-models to reason about longer plans,  relating models to other people.

Learning Mechanisms of Soar:  chunking (merging operators together) and reinforcement learning -- for aquiring procedural knowledge.  episodic and semantic learning aquire their corresponding types of declarative knowledge.  
	- Chunking is when one or more result is produced in a subgoal.  Soar produces a new chunk, represented as a production rule, which summarizes the procssing that generated the results.

- A chunks actions are based on teh results, whereas its conditions are based on those aspects of the goals above the subgoal that were relevant 

Conditions and Actions (IF-DO rules)


Reinforcement learning adjusts numeric values associated with rules that help select operators.

Epsidoc learning records the contents of working memory in snapshots, while semantic learning stores individual elements of working memory for later retrieval.



ACT
----
In continuous development since late 1970s.   A set of modules for processing different types of information.  
	- sensory modules: visual processing, 
	- motor moduals for action,
	- intentional modules for goals
	- declarative modules for long-term declarative knowledge.

Each module has an associated buffer that holds the relational declarative structure

- These comprise ACT-R's short term memory.

A centralized long-term production memory coordinates the processing of the modules.

The conditions of each production tests chunks 


PRODIGY (Cabronell, Knoblock and Minton, 1990)
=======
Two kinds of knowledge. 
	1. Domain rules:
		- Describe IF-DO-THEN rules.
			- THEN is described as the addition or deletion of first-order expressions.
		- These refer to bo th physical actions that affect the environm,ent and also to inference rules (purely cognitive).
	2. Control rules specify the conditions under which teh architecture shouldd select, reject or prefer a given operator (or set of operators), or goal/problems-state during the search process.

Like Soar, PRODIGY's basic problem-solving module involves search through a problem space to achieve one or more goals, which are first-order epxresion.
	- Search uses Means-Ends Analysis, where search is for a path of operators to get from the current state to the goal state.
	- On each cycle, Prodigy uses its control rules to select an operator, binding set state, or goal, to reject them out of hand, or to prefer some over the other.
	- When no control knowledge applies, it makes choses at random and carries out depth-first means-end search with backtracking.

Prodigy's explanation-based learning module constructs control rules based on its problem-solving experience.  Successful achievement of a goal after search leads to the creation or preference rules related to that goal and the operators whose application achieved it.  Failure to achieve a goal leads to teh creation of rejection or preference rules for operators, goald and states that did not produce a solution.

Credit assignment
**EM similar to the PRODIGY framework.
To generate the control rules, it analyzes problem-solving traces.0


ICARUS (Langley, Cummings and Shapiro, 2004)
======
Two distinct forms of knowledge.
	1. concepts describe classies of environmental situations in terms of other concepts and precepts,
		- 'grounded' in perceptions	
	2. skills specify how to achieve goals by decomposing them into ordered subgoals.
		- grounded in executable actions.
		- refer to concepts in their heads, IF conditions, and CONTINUE-IF conditions.

Operates on a recognize-act cycle.  On each step, the architecture deposits descriptions of visible objects into a perceptual buffer. 
- Comparse primitive concepts to these precepts and adds matched instances to short-term memory as beliefs.
- These trigger matches of higher-elevel concepts until it infereces all deductively implied beliefs.
Starting from the top-level goal, it finds a path through the skill hierarchy in which each subskill has satisfied conditionqs but an unsatisifed goal.  When a path terminates in a primtive skill with executable actions, the architecture applies these actions to affect hte environm,ent.

This leads to new preceps, chanes in beliefs and relactive execution fo additional skill paths to achieve the agents goals.

IUf it encounters similar problems in the future, it executes the learned skills to handle them reactively, without the need for deliberative problems olving.
	- both involve realations among objects, and both impose a hiearchical organization on long-term memory,


3T
==

Three separate long-term emories and algorithms that encode knowledgea bout situated skills, skill sequencs and abstract operators.  Each skill specifies the form of its inputs and outputs it must take along with an intialization routeine.  





Capabilities of Cognitive Architecturez
==============================
- A central issues is how to let agents access different sources of knowledge.
	- Knowledge about the environment comes from perception,
	- knowledge about implications of the current situation comes through planning, reasoning, and prediction. 
	- knowledge from other agents comes via communication
	- knowledge from the past comes through remembering.

- whether the cognitive architecture supports a capabiltity directily using embedded processes, or whether it instead provides ways to implement that capabiltity in terms of knowledge.

a) Recognition and Categorization
- The contact between its environment and its knowledge. 
- This requires the ability to recognize situations or events as instances of known or familiar patterns.
	- Static and dynamiic events (e.g. the different types of fencing attacks)
- Recognition is related to categorization, the assignment of objects, situations and events to known concepts or categories.
	- Cognitive architecture typically assume recognition is aprimitive process that occurs on a single cycle tand that underlies many higher-level functions, whereas categorization is sometimes viewed as a higher-level function.

They are linked to perceptions, they operate on output from the perceptual system, and some frameworks viewt hem as indistinguishable.
- they both operate on 

- how to learn new patterns or categories from instruction and experience

To compare all of these architectures.

b) Decsion making
 - 

1.Recognition and Categorizaton
	(a) relationship between environment and its knowledge.
		- perceptual categorization- recognizing static and dynamic objects, situations and events. 
			i. a primitive process or high-level process?
		- the fusion of knowledge, environment (perception), goals, internal representation of the situation, 
	(b) how new categories are learned, old ones are refined, etc?

	1. when a current situation matches another problem (e.g., deliberative critic-selectors retrieve 'ways to think')
	2. when a current problem-solving state matches another  -- the goal state or one of many problem-states.
		a. on failture
			- reflective critic selectors retireve ways diagnose the problem and debug the representations, by
				- adding new censors, suppressors  to change, attached to various conditions (to prevent them from being evoked again)
				- altering ways to categorize and retrieve semantic knowledge(e.g. ignored salient feature of frame/category)
				- changing interconcept relations (e.g., adding/removing causal  structures)
				- adding new effects, making exceptions to the generalizaiton process, etc.  
		b. on success
			- identifying the coponents that lead to the good decsion to make that 'way to think' more likely to be selected the next time (eg, adjust weight or make rule conditions more general)
			- evoke 'pleasure' as a way to freeze the brain from haivng another thought and interfering with memory traces.
	
2.  Decsion-making
	(a) conflict-resolution: when mutiple possible paths to a goal, which one to select?
		- envisigate mutliple outcomes (their consequences)  (IF-DO-THEN rules?)
		- caculate potential success or reward
	
	 	** Justified decisions, 
			- recognizing which representaitons/ relationships influenced the decisions.
				- to store the decision as a memory (episodic)
						
	- stored this as an 'epsidoic memory'?
            
	- compiled versus interpreted knowledge
		- reflective-based categorization versus automatic categorization?
	(b) how to 

1. Selecting problem-solving schemes.
	(a) credit assignement.
		i. on success
		ii. on failure
	(b) way to represent the current problem / state  / how are goals represented?
	(a) how are goals represented?
	(b) how do problems become goals?
	(c) how are goals changed or altered (e.g., imprimers)


	If the problem-solving scheme involves search.
		(a) how are changes represented (e.g., addition/deletion of operators, STRIPS style)
		(b) how is knowledge represented

2. Solving problems
	(a) what happens when things go wrong?
		- eg. impasse, elevation, 
		- there are a number of ways things 'go wrong' including
		   i. the current problem doesn't look like anything
		  ii. unforseen outcome.
                   - EM theory views failure as an opportunity to .learn, but since there are so many possibile ways to fail, this requires a lot of reasoning.
			- this requires the ability to represent its own deliberative/planning processes (or leave traces).

3. Self-knowledge 
	(a) how does the system model its own abilities?
		- to use this knowledge for negative inference 
		- to use this knowledge to constrain the search in planning
		- to use this knowledge to infer the inentions/goals of other people.
	(b) 

4. Learning mechanisms.

abstract = {Learning, planning, and representing knowledge at multiple levels of temporal abstractionare key challenges for AI. In this paper we develop an approach to these problemsbased on the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes(MDPs). We extend the usual notion of action to include options---whole coursesof behavior that may be temporally extended, stochastic, and contingent on events. Examplesof options include picking up an object, going to lunch, and traveling to a distantcity, as well as primitive actions such as muscle twitches and joint torques. Options maybe given a priori, learned by experience, or both. They may be used interchangeably withactions in a variety of planning and learning methods. The theory of semi-Markov decisionprocesses (SMDPs) can be applied to model the consequences of options and as a basis forplanning and learning methods using them. In this paper we develop these connections,building on prior work by...},

abstract = {Many otherwise puzzling aspects of the way we see brightness, colour, orientation and motion can be understood in wholly empirical terms. The evidence reviewed here leads to the conclusion that visual percepts are based on patterns of reflex neural activity shaped entirely by the past success (or failure) of visually guided behaviour in response to the same or a similar retinal stimulus. As a result, the images we see accord with what the sources of the stimuli have typically turned out to be, rather than with the physical properties of the relevant objects. If vision does indeed depend upon this operational strategy to generate optimally useful perceptions of inevitably ambiguous stimuli, then the underlying neurobiological processes will eventually need to be understood within this conceptual framework.},

title = {Topics in semantic representation},
abstract = {Processing language requires the retrieval of concepts from memory in response to an ongoing stream of information. This retrieval is facilitated if one can infer the gist of a sentence, conversation, or document and use that gist to predict related concepts and disambiguate words. This article analyzes the abstract computational problem underlying the extraction and use of gist, formulating this problem as a rational statistical inference. This leads to a novel approach to semantic representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure.},

title = {Self-Segmentation of Sequences: Automatic Formation of Hierarchies of Sequential Behaviors},
abstract = {The paper presents an approach for hierarchical reinforcement learning that does not rely on a priori domain-specific knowledge regarding hierarchical structures. Thus this work deals with a more difficult problem compared with existing work. It involves learning to segment action sequences to create hierarchical structures (for example, for the purpose of dealing with partially observable Markov decision processes, with multiple limited-memory or memoryless modules). Segmentation is based on reinforcement received during task execution, with different levels of control communicating with each other through sharing reinforcement estimates obtained by each other. The algorithm segments action sequences to reduce non-Markovian temporal dependencies, and seeks out proper configurations of long- and short-range dependencies, to facilitate the learning of the overall task. Developing hierarchies also facilitates the extraction of explicit hierarchical plans. The initial experiments dem...},

problem with the studies?

they present participants with unnatural forms of information -- single event or epistemic probabilities instead of naturally samples frequencies. 

Bayes theorem does not prescribe how one should set the pior propabilitiy of the likelihoods.   Most researchers have assumed that experimental participants should set them based on the statistics provided, setting the prior equal to the base-rate.
	-base-rate refers to the statistic sumarizing how often H has been true in "similar previous situations", independent of whether the new data D was observed.
	-base-rate neglect refers to the errors in this assumption or ignoring the influence of P(H) in baye's rule.
	- people neglect the base-rate (the prior) in favor of the likelihoods, rather than combining the two via Baye's rule to calculate the posterior.

Among children who were not visited, those with a high Fantasy Orientation believed more strongly than did those with a low Fantasy Orientation. Belief remained high one year later. At both time points, the number of other fantastical beings in which a child believed was significantly related to belief in the Candy Witch.},

title = {One-year follow-up of percutaneous septal ablation for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in 312 patients: predictors of hemodynamic and clinical response},
abstract = {AIM : The aim of this study was to analyze hemodynamic and clinical outcome in a cohort of 312 patients who were followed up over a period of 12 months after alcohol septal ablation (PTSMA) for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). METHODS AND RESULTS : PTSMA was intended in 337 patients with HOCM (mean age: 54+/-15 years), with 312 procedures completed by injection of 2.8+/-1.2 ml of alcohol. In 25 patients (8%) the intervention was aborted, mostly because of contrast echocardiographic findings. In the 312 patients who received alcohol, permanent pacing was necessary in 22 cases (7%); and in-hospital mortality was 1.3% (four patients). During follow-up, contact to six patients (2%) was lost, and three additional patients (1%) died. The 299 patients who either underwent non-invasive reassessment in our institution or transmitted followup data from their local physician formed the study population. Improvement in symptoms was reported by 272 patients (91%). Mean NYHA functional class was reduced from 2.9+/-0.4 to 1.5+/-0.7 (p<0.0001) along with a gradient reduction (echo-Doppler) from 59+/-32 to 8+/-15 mmHg at rest, and from 120+/-42 to 28+/-32 mmHg with provocation (p<0.0001 each). Exercise capacity improved from 94+/-51 to 119+/-40 watts (p=0.001), and peak oxygen consumption from 18+/-4 to 21+/-6 ml/ kg/min (p=0.01). Younger age and higher outflow gradients at baseline and immediately after intervention were associated with a less favorable hemodynamic outcome. The degree of limitation of exercise capacity at baseline was the only predictor of symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSIONS : Catheter- based septal ablation is an effective non-surgical technique for reducing symptoms and outflow gradients in HOCM. In contrast to a previous study, in this cohort of 312 patients there was no association between post-interventional enzyme release and hemodynamic success. Younger patients with high baseline gradients, however, tended to have a less favorable hemodynamic outcome with higher residual gradients.},

title = {Multiple organisations of events in memory},
abstract = {Theories of memory organisation propose that activity knowledge organises autobiographical memory globally. According to these views, memories that share a participant, location, or time are only organised together if they also share an activity. If they do not, they are nested within their respective activity organisations locally rather than being organised together globally. Two experiments that assessed people's clustering of laboratory events consistently obtained findings that contradict this view. Both experiments found that people organise event memories globally in non-activity clusters, cross-classify events into multiple organisations, and pivot between activity and non-activity clusters. Consistent with studies of naturalistic events, these studies of laboratory events indicate that people cross-classify event memories simultaneously into multiple global organisations.},

title = {Grit: perseverance and passion for long-term goals},
abstract = {The importance of intellectual talent to achievement in all professional domains is well established, but less is known about other individual differences that predict success. The authors tested the importance of 1 noncognitive trait: grit. Defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, grit accounted for an average of 4% of the variance in success outcomes, including educational attainment among 2 samples of adults (N=1,545 and N=690), grade point average among Ivy League undergraduates (N=138), retention in 2 classes of United States Military Academy, West Point, cadets (N=1,218 and N=1,308), and ranking in the National Spelling Bee (N=175). Grit did not relate positively to IQ but was highly correlated with Big Five Conscientiousness. Grit nonetheless demonstrated incremental predictive validity of success measures over and beyond IQ and conscientiousness. Collectively, these findings suggest that the achievement of difficult goals entails not only talent but also the sustained and focused application of talent over time.},

abstract = {Choosing an action that leads to a desired goal requires an understanding of the linkages between actions and their outcomes. We investigated neural mechanisms of such goal-based action selection. We trained monkeys on a task in which the relation between visual cues, action types, and reward conditions changed regularly, such that the monkeys selected their actions based on anticipated reward conditions. A significant number of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex were activated, after cue presentation and before motor execution, only by particular action-reward combinations. This prefrontal activity is likely to underlie goal-based action selection.},

title = {Syntactic priming in comprehension: evidence from event-related potentials},
abstract = {Syntactic priming is the facilitation of processing that occurs when a sentence has the same syntactic form as a preceding sentence. Such priming effects have been less consistently demonstrated in comprehension than in production, and those that have been reported have depended on the repetition of verbs across sentences. In an event-related potential experiment, subjects read target sentences containing reduced-relative clauses. Each was preceded by a sentence that contained the same verb and either a reduced-relative or a main-clause construction. Reduced-relative primes elicited a larger positivity than did main-clause primes. Reduced-relative targets that were preceded by a main-clause prime elicited a greater positivity than the same target sentences following a reduced-relative prime. In addition, syntactic priming effects were dissociated from effects of lexical repetition at the verb.},

title = {Local graph alignment and motif search in biological networks},
abstract = {Interaction networks are of central importance in post-genomic molecular biology, with increasing amounts of data becoming available by high-throughput methods. Examples are gene regulatory networks or protein interaction maps. The main challenge in the analysis of these data is to read off biological functions from the topology of the network. Topological motifs, i.e., patterns occurring repeatedly at different positions in the network have recently been identified as basic modules of molecular information processing. In this paper, we discuss motifs derived from families of mutually similar but not necessarily identical patterns. We establish a statistical model for the occurrence of such motifs, from which we derive a scoring function for their statistical significance. Based on this scoring function, we develop a search algorithm for topological motifs called graph alignment, a procedure with some analogies to sequence alignment. The algorithm is applied to the gene regulation network of E. coli.},

What are events?


{\#}{\#} Atomic Complements of Events: Basic Action

Actions are performed by actors.  Some events are not.
Actions happen in the world.  Events require an observer and can be of an action or another type of 


Quine (1985): treat events as objects-- bounded reigions of space-time.

Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976): events are dynamic objects.

Events have boundaries in time and time.

Partonomy (Miller {\&} Johnson-Laird)-  a hierarchical relationship between parts and sub-parts of objects.   Partonomic relationships give rise to distinctive spatial configurations that can be of use in categorizing objects.

Taxononomy - a hierarchy of kind-of relationships.   Works for exents: "frisbee golf" - "golf" - "sport".   Partonomies do not generalize to Taxonomies.

Objects and events can be referred to at varying levels of abstraction.  The privilaged level, the basic levl

Is there are a privilaged 

Morris and Murphy - basic level of event categories.

Event categories were most differentiated at the subordinate level, rather than the basic level; within-category similarity increased more from the basic level to the subordinate level than from the subordinate level to the basic level.


What level to stop specification?    Relative within-category similarity improvement on vertical descent down concept hierarchy.

The scene is a level in the partonomic hierarchy. 

Privilaged level of partonomy: "behavior epsiodes" or "scenes" 
privilaged level of taxonomy: basic level

basic-level events: psychologically privilaged taxnomic levels.



On the scale from a few minutes to a few-hours, events are characterized by plots-- the goals and plans of their participants.

Longer, they are characterized thematically.



When processing an event, attention may be guided by conceptual expectations, prioer experience what that class of event, or perceptual characteristics of the part of the event that has unfolded so far.  

Borrowed from object perception:
1. both objects and events form partonomic structures,
2. both objects and events form taxonomic structures, with a privilaged basic level.
3. both bojects and events, there are systematic relationships between partonomy and taxonomy: at the basic level, objects and events are characterized by good parts.
4.  difference: events can only be experienced once.

People tend 
to divide the stream of behavior into smaller units when it is unpredictable 
(Newtson, 1973; Vallacher {\&} Wegner, 1987; Wilder, 1978a; Wilder, 1978b), or 
when they are instructed to focus on the task rather than impressions of the 
actor (Cohen {\&} Ebbesen, 1979)


dividing perceptual streams. 

hierarchical partonomies, of sequences of events.  

 Talmy (1975) argues that there is a paradigmatic structure to 
motion events: they consist of figure (which is a nominal), a motion (which is a 
verb), a path (which is a prepositional) and a ground (which is a nominal)

Event representations are (a) structured and (b) closely tied to goals and causes.

Moens and Steedman (1988).  



Dustins' cognitive difference model of pragmatics.
Lingustic expressions are decoded in a persons mind and recgonized to have a different origin, and compared to construct representations of different goals and values.   This could be turned on or off, and results in the different ways to react to commands, following from assimilation of their goals to compliance or rejection or disapproval.



The representation of events
Rumelhart 1980

Repeated exposure to an event category leads to the creation of a schema for that category. 
1. provide for variable finding, 
2. embdeeding, for the partonomic structure of activity
3. levels of abstractions: taxonomic sturcture.

Partonomy of goals

goal-orientedness of event-schemata allows prediction of future activity and inference of missing information.

Goals are iimportant in evneent perception

title = {A test of the regulatory fit hypothesis in perceptual classification learning.},
abstract = {This article builds a bridge between research on regulatory focus in motivation and classification learning. It tests the hypothesis that a fit between the situational regulatory focus and the reward structure of the task leads to greater cognitive flexibility than does a mismatch between situational focus and the reward structure and that the fit between the regulatory-focus-induced processing characteristics and the nature of the environment influences performance. In Experiment 1, we used a classification task for which cognitive flexibility should be advantageous and examined both gains (Experiment 1A) and losses (Experiment 1B) reward structures. In Experiments 2 and 3, we used a classification task for which cognitive flexibility should be disadvantageous. In Experiment 2, we used a gains reward structure, and in Experiment 3, we used a losses reward structure. As was predicted, when cognitive flexibility was advantageous, the participants in a regulatory fit showed faster learning and more quickly shifted toward the optimal response strategy. Also as was predicted, when cognitive flexibility was disadvantageous, the participants in a regulatory mismatch showed faster learning and more quickly shifted toward the optimal response strategy. Implications for current theories of motivation and classification learning are discussed.},

title = {The Construction of Situation Models in Narrative Comprehension: An Event-Indexing Model},
annote = {Zwaan proposed that these 5 components are used to index internal representations of the situation described by the narrative.  There are two assumptions underlying this theory.  First, when there is a discontinuation between the reader's mental model and evidence in the text (ie. a change in any one of these dimensions), the user searches for (or constructs) a new model.   Secondly, this process of updating models results in a significant delay in the subject's reading speed.

Event similarity is a function of how many of these features are shared.


Verbs denote actions and events, which have temporal, spatial, causal and intentional dimensions.

abstract = {Rips and Estin (1998) provided evidence that mental events such as dreaming are more homogeneous than physical events such as checking out a book; that is, their parts are more difficult to distinguish. In their experiment, participants listed more distinctive properties for the parts of physical events than for the parts of mental events. However, the physicality of stimuli was confounded with temporal aspects. Mental stimuli tended to be processes, and physical stimuli, events. This study tested homogeneity with new stimuli separating out the factors of physicality and aspect. Consistently, both physicality and aspect had significant effects on the perceived homogeneity of activities, as measured by the number of listed parts, the number of distinctive properties of each part, and homogeneity ratings. The study shows that homogeneity is strongly influenced by aspect but that physicality remains a robust factor for homogeneity, even after taking aspect into account.},

title = {Teleological reasoning in infancy: the na{\"\i}ve theory of rational action},
annote = {inferring desires of agents is important, because we assume that they are acting rationally on their beliefs to infer their desires.   The active desire (intention -- is it?) can be inferred from 

rational goal-directed action within the world of their beliefs.


At as early as 12 months, human infants appear to conceive as actions as goal-directed behavior.   In an violation-of-expectation looking time experiment, infants are habituated to an animation of a yellow ball moving laterally toward a red ball, while jumping over a wall that blocks the direct path between the balls.   Because the infants conceptualize the yellow ball's behavior as goal directed,  they are suprised to see the ball continue to jump when the wall is removed; instead, they expect the yellow ball to travel in a straight line to the red ball.  More generally, we posit that infants expect agents to rationally pursue their goals in light of their environment and beliefs.


The ability to characterize the behavior of moving objects in terms of agents pursuing goals appears in humans as young as 12 months.  },

title = {Formation of category representations},
abstract = {Many formal models of categorization assume, implicitly or explicitly, that categorization results in the formation of direct associations from representations of the presented stimuli to representations of the experimentally provided category labels. In three categorization experiments employing a polymorphous classification structure (Dennis, Hampton, {\&} Lea, 1973) and a partial reversal, optional shift procedure (Kendler, Kendler, {\&} Wells, 1960), we provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that learning a new classification problem results in the creation of category representations that mediate between representations of the stimulus and the label. This hypothesis can be instantiated through the AMBRY model (Kruschke, 1996).},

title = {How causal knowledge affects classification: A generative theory of categorization.},
abstract = {Several theories have been proposed regarding how causal relations among features of objects affect how those objects are classified. The assumptions of these theories were tested in 3 experiments that manipulated the causal knowledge associated with novel categories. There were 3 results. The 1st was a multiple cause effect in which a feature's importance increases with its number of causes. The 2nd was a coherence effect in which good category members are those whose features jointly corroborate the category's causal knowledge. These 2 effects can be accounted for by assuming that good category members are those likely to be generated by a category's causal laws. The 3rd result was a primary cause effect, in which primary causes are more important to category membership. This effect can also be explained by a generative account with an additional assumption: that categories often are perceived to have hidden generative causes.},

Goals can be elicited by 

- overview of goal attainment:  Custers {\&} Aarts 2005; Moskowitz, Li and Kirk 2004)

People are able to set and pursue goals automatically without thought or intent. 

Automatic goal pursuit.    

Goals are mentally represented desired states that pertain to behaviors or outcomes.  (Carver {\&} Scheier, 1998;  Gollwitzer {\&} Moskowitz 1996).

Representing and refelecting upon goals helps users attain their goals (Geen 1995; Hyland 1988, Toates 1986)

Whence goals?
- Primed by situational cues.

One can only prime goals when they are there.


To what extent can people's goal selection be manipulated?
1. knowledge of their goals helps people decide to pursue those goals (although these are goals the user already has) and peform better at acheiving those goals
2. assocaitions to constituents of plans around a goal can help people to acheive those goals (thinking of a friend primes the "helping" goal).

abstract = {The mounting evidence for neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has fundamentally challenged the traditional view of brain development. The intense search for clues as to the functional significance of the new neurons has uncovered a surprising connection between neurogenesis and depression. In animal models of depression, neurogenesis is reduced, whereas many treatments for depression promote neurogenesis. We speculate on why the hippocampus, traditionally viewed as a memory structure, might be involved in mood disorders, and what specific role the new neurons might have in the pathogenesis of and recovery from depression. The proposed role of neurogenesis in contextual-memory formation predicts a specific pattern of cognitive deficits in depression and has important implications for treatment of this highly prevalent and debilitating disorder.},

title = {Heterarchy of cognition: the depths and the highs of a framework for memory research},
abstract = {To celebrate the levels-of-processing approach, I describe a multilevel evolutionary architecture for human behaviour and cognition. New experimental data on human eye movements are presented that demonstrate a possibility of splitting visual perceptual activity at least on two hierarchical but closely interrelated levels of processing. Furthermore, data from behavioural studies of human memory and neuroimaging testify that within the domain of cognition proper two higher levels can be differentiated. I call them "conceptual structures" and "metacognitive coordinations" and provide evidence that the latter may residue in the phylogenetically new structures of prefrontal and particularly right prefrontal cortices. From this point of few, the most natural framework for an analysis of the levels-of-processing effects on human memory is to consider them as interactions within the main gradients of evolution and development of the corresponding neurophysiological mechanisms. Finally, several new, still unanswered questions for the future research are formulated.},

title = {The representation of object concepts in the brain},
abstract = {Evidence from functional neuroimaging of the human brain indicates that information about salient properties of an object-such as what it looks like, how it moves, and how it is used-is stored in sensory and motor systems active when that information was acquired. As a result, object concepts belonging to different categories like animals and tools are represented in partially distinct, sensory- and motor property-based neural networks. This suggests that object concepts are not explicitly represented, but rather emerge from weighted activity within property-based brain regions. However, some property-based regions seem to show a categorical organization, thus providing evidence consistent with category-based, domain-specific formulations as well.},

In a yes-no recognition task, only the spatial sentences group made more false alarms toward the center of the spatial category than in the other direction; three other comparison groups showed no such tendency. This shift toward the core of the semantic category suggests that spatial language interacted with perceptual information during encoding. In Experiment 3, we varied the materials to test the interactive encoding account against a separate encoding account in which separately stored sentences are accessed during picture recognition. The results support the interactive encoding account in which spatial language influences the encoding and memory of spatial relations.},

The authors evaluate the Botvinick and Plaut account by contrasting the simple recurrent network model of Botvinick and Plaut with their own more traditional hierarchically structured interactive activation model (R. P. Cooper {\&} T. Shallice, 2000). The authors present a range of arguments and additional simulations that demonstrate theoretical and empirical difficulties for both Botvinick and Plaut's model and their theoretical position. The authors conclude that explicit hierarchically organized and causally efficacious schema and goal representations are required to provide an adequate account of the flexibility of sequential behavior.},

Objects are in latent classes which influence the relations that hold among a set of objects. 

- Relations allow us to predict the interactions between novel objects in each domain.

- Attributes: properties on individual objects
- Relations: specify how objects interact 

- IRM: learns categories with both attributes and relations.


Generative model in which a particular relation holds between a pair of objects with some probability that depends only on the classes of those objects.

Similar to th e stochastic blockmodel, except it does not depend on the number of classes.

People learn the number of classes at the same time they learn the class assignments.    IRM allows for an unbounded number of classes.

Given graph G with labeled edges between nodes (label = {0,1}) 
- Find best partition of objects into classes

Define process by which latent classes z and G are generated.

p(g_ij = 1) depends only on latent classes of i and j.

{\#} History

- Fodor proposed that perceptual processes are largely modular, but that central cognitive processes are largely non-modular.

- Rats confuse diagonally opposite locations in a rectangular arena, suggesting that the rat only encoded the geometric properties of space in making these rotational errors. 

- Geometry is the branch of mathematics used to characterize spatial relations.

{\#} Using goals in recommender systems

-View recommendations as a decision-making process.  Goals are used when making a deicsion.
People are not always aware of their goals, but all actions have goals.
Conversational recommenders - give an example and then change the attributes one at a time.


{\#}{\#} Determining the user's goal {\#}{\#}

1. ask the user
	- but users are not always good at articulating their goals (Kass and Finin 1988)
	
2. try to predict the user's current goal
	- this requires more knowledge about a user and the context than is currently possible to acquire

3. a combination of predicting and specifying.  

	- the recommender structures the items into different groups that correspond to different goals.  The user picks the group that best matches the current goal.

annote = {Cannot make general statements that can be reused over different constants.   There is no use remembering something that you will never retrieve again, so it helps to have domain theories that can work among many different sets of objects.   


Variables
Constants
	Object constants
	Function Constants
		 arity (positive integer)
	Relation Constants
		arity (positive integer)

Functional term: 
	- an expression of a n-arry function constant and the appropriate number of terms enlosed in parenthesis.


Sentences:
 - relational sentences 
- logical sentences
- quantified sentences

Relational basis set-- the relations in our conceptialization of the world (we may have ignored others)

generalitiy of relations can be determined by comparing their elements.   the on relation is less general than the above relation. since, when viewed as a set of tuples, it is a subset of the above relation.

conceptualization issues:
- grain size of objects: 
- 

The issue of grain size shows the need to switch through representations depending on the type of problems.  Can you think of any problems that would require moving between granularities of representations?

- reification 
  turning relations into objects on their own right by ading a partial function, sot that they can have their own relations to characterize them

Conceptualization based on utility. Not their fiedlity to the world.  Explain these distinctions using an embodied agent.
-------------

Semantics:

An interpertation i is a mapping from the constants into the elements of conceptualization.

title = {Cross-classification and category representation in children's concepts},
abstract = {Items commonly belong to many categories. Cross-classification is the classification of a single item into more than one category. This research explored 2- to 6-year-old children's use of 2 different category systems for cross-classification: script (e.g., school-time items, birthday party items) and taxonomic (e.g., animals, clothes). The results of Experiments 1 and 2 show that by a young age, children are able to cross-classify items into both category systems. Experiment 3 found that children mentally represent cross-classified items as simultaneously belonging to both taxonomic and script categories. Experiment 4 found that children often, but do not always, spontaneously activate taxonomic and script cross-classifications. Overall, the results demonstrate that from an early age children form and use both taxonomic and script categories for cross-classification.},

title = {Generalization, similarity, and Bayesian inference.},
abstract = {Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.},

abstract = {Categorization models based on laboratory research focus on a narrower range of explanatory constructs than appears necessary for explaining the structure of natural categories. This mismatch is caused by the reliance on classification as the basis of laboratory studies. Category representations are formed in the process of interacting with category members. Thus, laboratory studies must explore a range of category uses. The authors review the effects of a variety of category uses on category learning. First, there is an extensive discussion contrasting classification with a predictive inference task that is formally equivalent to classification but leads to a very different pattern of learning. Then, research on the effects of problem solving, communication, and combining inference and classification is reviewed.},

annote = {Meltzoff and Moore's AIM hypothesis

Imitation: mechanism for transferring (procedural?) knowledge from a skilled agent (instructor) to an unskilled agent (the observer) using direct demonstration.

Observer must determine
 - components of the environmental state that are relevant to the performing agent
- what actions the instruction performed (or intended to perform) to acheive a goal state.
- map the actions of the instructor to their own coordinate frame so they can execute those actions

imitation is 'goal directed'.   Make a distinction between the actions and the end state.

How are the target organs identified?
 - built in feature detectors? (areas of primate brains fire selectively when face / hands are shown)
- perceiving spatiotemporal movement patterns, matching the outputs of forward models of musicle groups with their visual correlates.

Body Babbling (Meltzoff and Moore 1997) - the development of models of muscle system's kinematics.

Inferring intention is the final developmental step of imitation.  Knowing what was meant before the actor achieves the goals tate.

AIM model

imitation is a matching-to-target process.

title = {Mapping information flow in sensorimotor networks},
abstract = {Biological organisms continuously select and sample information used by their neural structures for perception and action, and for creating coherent cognitive states guiding their autonomous behavior. Information processing, however, is not solely an internal function of the nervous system. Here we show, instead, how sensorimotor interaction and body morphology can induce statistical regularities and information structure in sensory inputs and within the neural control architecture, and how the flow of information between sensors, neural units, and effectors is actively shaped by the interaction with the environment. We analyze sensory and motor data collected from real and simulated robots and reveal the presence of information structure and directed information flow induced by dynamically coupled sensorimotor activity, including effects of motor outputs on sensory inputs. We find that information structure and information flow in sensorimotor networks (a) is spatially and temporally specific; (b) can be affected by learning, and (c) can be affected by changes in body morphology. Our results suggest a fundamental link between physical embeddedness and information, highlighting the effects of embodied interactions on internal (neural) information processing, and illuminating the role of various system components on the generation of behavior.},

title = {On doing two things at once: temporal constraints on actions in language comprehension},
abstract = {In two experiments, we investigated how text comprehension is influenced by the interaction between the properties of actions and the temporal relations specified by adverbs. Participants read short narratives describing a protagonist who performed two actions that involved similar sensorimotor systems (e.g., chopping wood and painting a fence) or different ones (e.g., whistling a melody and painting a fence). The actions were described as simultaneous or successive by means of the temporal adverbs while and after, respectively. Comprehension, both in Spanish and in English, was markedly impaired (longer reading times and lower subjective coherence) for sentences including the adverb while and actions involving the same sensorimotor system. However, when one of the same sensorimotor system actions was described as a mental plan (e.g., chopping wood and thinking of painting a fence), comprehension was equally easy with the adverbs while and after. These results are compatible with a revised version of the indexical hypothesis that specifies how comprehension is guided by syntax and embodied constraints within multiple noninteracting mental spaces.},

Hugging the woman and stating "You should hug me after you read the book too.  It will be closing parentheses."

Putnam's two theses.

1. Language speaking and other abilities currently do not fall within nautralistic inquiry
2. Nothing could be learned about meaning from the study of configurations and processes of the brain.

According to Chomsky, (1) is not properly formulated and (2) is too strong.

1. To speed up planning
 - chunking
- biase the search in the directions most likely to lead to high-quality plans

2. To improve the planning domain theory
- description of how the agent's actions affect its world.
- when plans fail, improve the domain theory.
 *** How does this type of learning compare with reflective learning?

3. To improve the quality of the plans
- biasing the plans toward a metric that defines a user's preferences in planning.



When learning takes place.
Before.  
	- pre processing domain theory
During Plan retrieval

Learning during the Execution of a Plan
	- either offline or online


Type of learning

1. Inductive (empirical)

abstract = {Three experiments compared the learning of lower-dimensional family resemblance categories (4 dimensions) with the learning of higher-dimensional ones (8 dimensions). Category-learning models incorporating error-driven learning, hypothesis testing, or limited capacity attention predict that additional dimensions should either increase learning difficulty or decrease learning of individual features. Contrary to these predictions, the experiments showed no slower learning of high-dimensional categories; instead, subjects learned more features from high-dimensional categories than from low-dimensional categories. This result obtained both in standard learning with feedback and in noncontingent, observational learning. These results show that rather than interfering with learning, categories with more dimensions cause individuals to learn more. The authors contrast the learning of family resemblance categories with learning in classical conditioning and probability learning paradigms, in which competition among features is well documented.},

Osherton's Similarity Coverage Model
	- people extend a predicate from a base premise to a target premise to the extent that the target category is similar to the base category.

	 for generalization

	predicts 'typicality effects' (generalization is stronger for prototypical instances-- those that are 'more similar' to other category members)

	- has a single parameter to reflect the weight given to the similarity and coverage components.


Feature-based Induction Model (FBIM) 
	- induction is strong to the extent that the premise and conclusion categories share features.
	- does not distinguish between different 'levels' of categorization.  Assumes, all categories are represented in terms of features and that argument strength

Hypothesis-based Induction (McDonald, Sameuls and Rispoli)
- induction is guided more by theories / explanations than similarity

Bayesian Model (Heit)

--

The lack of generality of typicality and diversity effects beyond 

Relevance theory.
	relevance as a property of inputs to cognitive processes.

	- the greater the relevance, to lesser the effort required to access it


when a 'blank' property is associated with some premise category, people tend to associate that property with the most distinctive or informative features or categories with the premise.

title = {Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with the MAXQ Value Function Decomposition},
abstract = {This paper presents the MAXQ approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning based on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy of smaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an additive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the design tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning.},

title = {Computational and evolutionary aspects of language},
abstract = {Language is our legacy. It is the main evolutionary contribution of humans, and perhaps the most interesting trait that has emerged in the past 500 million years. Understanding how darwinian evolution gives rise to human language requires the integration of formal language theory, learning theory and evolutionary dynamics. Formal language theory provides a mathematical description of language and grammar. Learning theory formalizes the task of language acquisition it can be shown that no procedure can learn an unrestricted set of languages. Universal grammar specifies the restricted set of languages learnable by the human brain. Evolutionary dynamics can be formulated to describe the cultural evolution of language and the biological evolution of universal grammar.},

title = {The reign of typicality in semantic memory},
abstract = {This paper begins with a brief description of a theoretical framework for semantic memory, in which processing is inherently sensitive to the varying typicality of its representations. The approach is then elaborated with particular regard to evidence from semantic dementia, a disorder resulting in relatively selective deterioration of conceptual knowledge, in which cognitive performance reveals ubiquitous effects of typicality. This applies to frankly semantic tasks (like object naming), where typicality can be gauged by the extent to which an object or concept is characterized by shared features in its category. It also applies in tasks apparently requiring only access to a 'surface' representation (such as lexical decision) or translation from one surface representation to another (like reading words aloud), where typicality is defined in terms of the structure of the surface domain(s). The effects of surface-domain typicality also appear early in the time course of word and object processing by normal participants, as revealed in event-related potential studies. These results suggest that perceptual and conceptual processing form an interactive continuum rather than distinct stages, and that typicality effects reign throughout this continuum.},

title = {Representing episodic memory in a system-level model of the brain},
abstract = {We discuss the problem of finding neuroscientific and psychologically plausible representa- 
tions of the memories of events and episodes. In order to do this we need to take into account 
the neuroanatomical connectivity between the cortex and the hippocampal complex, and also 
the cognitive psychology of episodic memory. We then need to develop a model of the cortex 
and hippocampal complex and to find representations of events that are consistent with 
biological information-processing constraints. We conclude that events and episodes can be 
represented by certain codes which are stored in associative memories. },

abstract = {The authors examined how situation models are updated during text comprehension. If comprehenders keep track of the evolving situation, they should update their models such that the most current information, the here and now, is more available than outdated information. Contrary to this updating hypothesis, E. J. O'Brien, M. L. Rizzella, J. E. Albrecht, and J. G. Halleran (1998) obtained results suggesting that outdated or incorrect information may still influence the comprehension process. The authors of the current study demonstrate that the nature of E. J. O'Brien et al.'s materials were the likely cause of this pattern of results. Hence, the current authors constructed materials that circumvent identified confounds and in a reading-time experiment obtained evidence supporting the here-and-now hypothesis.},

title = {Self-Segmentation of Sequences},
abstract = {The paper presents an approach for hierarchicalreinforcement learning that does not rely on a priorihierarchical structures. Thus the approach deals with amore difficult problem compared with existing work. It involveslearning to segment sequences to create hierarchicalstructures, based on reinforcement received during task execution,with different levels of control communicating witheach other through sharing reinforcement estimates obtainedby each others. The algorithm segments sequences to reducenon-Markovian temporal dependencies, to facilitate thelearning of the overall task. Initial experiments demonstratedthe basic promise of the approach.I. IntroductionAlthough hierarchical approaches are evidently importantto reinforcement learning, most existing hierarchicalRL models either do not involve automaticallydeveloping hierarchies (i.e., using pre-determined hierarchies;e.g., Dayan and Hinton 1993, Sutton 1995, Precupet al 1998, Parr and Russell 1997, Dietterich ...},

title = {The neurophysiology of the sexual cycle},
abstract = {The cycle of sexual activity in men and women occurs in 4 phases--excitation, plateau, orgasm, resolution--which are guided by sexual desire. Male sexual activity is characterized by erection, seminal emission and ejaculation (orgasm), whereas female sexual activity is characterized by vaginal lubrication, erection of the clitoris and orgasm. These responses are under the control of numerous central and peripheral neural systems. The central supraspinal systems are mainly localized in the limbic system (olfactory nuclei, medial preoptic area, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus etc.), in the hypothalamus and its nuclei (paraventricular and ventromedial nuclei). Neural information travels through the brain stem, the medulla oblongata, the spinal cord and the autonomous nervous system to the genital apparatus. While we have very detailed knowledge of the neural mechanism, which controls the function of the male and female genital organs, in particular those mediating erection, very little is known of the central mechanism involved. Nevertheless, several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, such as dopamine, glutamic acid, nitric oxide, oxytocin, ACTH-MSH peptides, are known to facilitate sexual function, while serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and opioid peptides reduce it. At the level of the paraventricular nucleus a group of oxytocinergic neurons projecting to extra-hypothalamic brain areas, including the spinal cord, have been identified, which facilitate erectile function and copulation when activated and reduce both when inhibited. Although the majority of results, which have clarified the mechanisms involved, have been performed in males, it is believed that similar mechanisms are also operative in females.},

title = {Logical and Relational Learning: Ch1},
abstract = {This textbook covers logical and relational learning in depth, and hence provides an introduction to inductive logic programming (ILP), multirelational data mining (MRDM) and (statistical) relational learning (SRL). These subfields of data mining and machine learning are concerned with the analysis of complex and structured data sets that arise in numerous applications, such as bio- and chemoinformatics, network analysis, Web mining, and natural language processing, within the rich representations offered by relational databases and computational logic.The author introduces the machine learning and representational foundations of the field and explains some important techniques in detail by using some of the classic case studies centered around well-known logical and relational systems.
The book is suitable for use in graduate courses and should be of interest to graduate students and researchers in computer science, databases and artificial intelligence, as well as practitioners of data mining and machine learning. It contains numerous figures and exercises, and slides are available for many chapters.},

abstract = {In this article, we review some of the most provocative experimental results to have emerged from comparative labs in the past few years, starting with research focusing on contingency learning and finishing with experiments exploring nonhuman animals' understanding of causal-logical relations. Although the theoretical explanation for these results is often inchoate, a clear pattern nevertheless emerges. The comparative evidence does not fit comfortably into either the traditional associationist or inferential alternatives that have dominated comparative debate for many decades now. Indeed, the similarities and differences between human and nonhuman causal cognition seem to be much more multifarious than these dichotomous alternatives allow.},

title = {Specialization and semantic organization: evidence for multiple semantics linked to sensory modalities},
abstract = {The present article reviews the case for multiple systems in semantic memory and empirically evaluates a multiple semantics proposal based on sensory modalities. In the experiments, a conceptual switching cost paradigm was used (Pecher, Zeelenberg, {\&} Barsalou, 2003), in which participants verified properties for concepts and verification time was compared for target trials (e.g., a dog can bark) that were preceded by context trials of either the same or a different modality (e.g., a bee can buzz or a horse can have spots). Experiment 1 involved a modality switch while controlling for the concept's category and demonstrated that when modalities were switched, a processing cost was incurred that could not be attributed to the latter dimension. Experiment 2 further supported this conclusion by showing that, in a reverse situation, the cost incurred when category was switched was at least smaller. The results are discussed by considering possible alternative amodal explanations and other data that have shown the influence of sensory information in conceptual processing.},

abstract = {An essential aspect of knowing language is knowing the words of that language. This knowledge is usually thought to reside in the mental lexicon, a kind of dictionary that contains information regarding a word's meaning, pronunciation, syntactic characteristics, and so on. In this article, a very different view is presented. In this view, words are understood as stimuli that operate directly on mental states. The phonological, syntactic and semantic properties of a word are revealed by the effects it has on those states.},

abstract = {In three experiments, we examined mediated learning in situations involving learning a large amount of information. Participants learned 144 "facts" during a learning phase and were tested on facts during a test phase. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants learned facts about familiar individuals, unfamiliar individuals, or unfamiliar individuals associated with familiar individuals. Prior knowledge reduced interference, even when it played only a mediating role. In Experiment 3, participants learned facts about unfamiliar individuals or unfamiliar countries, with half the participants in each group associating the unfamiliar items with familiar individuals. Again, use of prior knowledge to mediate learning reduced interference even when the new information was conceptually dissimilar to the previously known information. These results are consistent with the mental model account of long-term memory.},
