%************************************************
This bundle for \LaTeX\ has two goals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide students with an easy-to-use template for their
    Master's
    or PhD thesis. (Though it might also be used by other types of
    authors
    for reports, books, etc.)
    \item Provide a classic, high quality typographic style which is
    inspired by \cauthor{bringhurst:2002}'s ``\emph{The Elements of
    Typographic Style}'' \citep{bringhurst:2002}.
    \graffito{\myTitle \myVersion}
\end{enumerate}
The bundle is configured to run with a \emph{full} 
MiK\TeX\ or \TeX Live\footnote{See the file \texttt{LISTOFFILES} for
needed packages. Furthermore, \texttt{classicthesis} 
works with most other distributions and, thus, with most operating 
systems \LaTeX\ is available for.} 
installation right away and, therefore, it uses only freely available 
fonts. (Minion fans can easily adjust the style to their needs.)

People interested only in the nice style and not the whole bundle can
now use the style stand-alone via the file \texttt{classicthesis.sty}.
This works now also with ``plain'' \LaTeX.

This should enable anyone with a basic knowledge of \LaTeXe\ to
produce beautiful documents without too much effort. In the end, this
is my overall goal: more beautiful documents, especially theses, as I
am tired of seeing so many ugly ones.

The whole template and the used style is released under the
\textsmaller{GNU} General Public License. 

If you like the style then I would appreciate a postcard:
\begin{center}

The postcards I got so far are available at \url{http://postcards.miede.de}.

Hopefully, this thesis template is done well enough for your needs and
does not have too many flaws. So far, a couple of theses have been
typeset successfully with it. If you are interested in some
typographic details behind it, enjoy Robert Bringhurst's wonderful book.

\graffito{A well-balanced line width improves the legibility of
the text. That's what typography is all about, right?}
\paragraph{Important Note:} Some things of this style might look
unusual at first glance, many people feel so in the beginning.
However, all things are intentionally designed to be as they are,
especially these:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No bold fonts are used. Italics or spaced small caps do the
    job quite well.
    \item The size of the text body is intentionally shaped like it
    is. It supports both legibility and allows a reasonable amount of
    information to be on a page. And, no: the lines are not too short.
    \item The tables intentionally do not use vertical or double
    rules. See the documentation for the \texttt{booktabs} package for
    a nice discussion of this topic.\footnote{To be found online at \\
    \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/}.}
    \item And last but not least, to provide the reader with a way
    easier access to page numbers in the table of contents, the page
    numbers are right behind the titles. Yes, they are \emph{not}
    neatly aligned at the right side and they are \emph{not} connected
    with dots that help the eye to bridge a distance that is not
    necessary. If you are still not convinced: is your reader
    interested in the page number or does she want to sum the numbers
    up?
\end{itemize}
Therefore, please do not break the beauty of the style by changing
these things unless you really know what you are doing! Please.


\section{Organization}
A very important factor for successful thesis writing is the
organization of the material. This template suggests a structure as
the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \graffito{You can use these margins for summaries of the text
    body\dots}
    \item\texttt{Chapters/} is where all the ``real'' content goes in
    separate files such as \texttt{Chapter01.tex} etc.
 %  \item\texttt{Examples/} is where you store all listings and other
 %  examples you want to use for your text.
    \item\texttt{FrontBackMatter/} is where all the stuff goes that
    surrounds the ``real'' content, such as the acknowledgments,
    dedication, etc.
    \item\texttt{gfx/} is where you put all the graphics you use in
    the thesis. Maybe they should be organized into subfolders
    depending on the chapter they are used in, if you have a lot of
    graphics.
    \item\texttt{Bibliography.bib}: the Bib\TeX\ database to organize
    all the references you might want to cite.
    \item\texttt{classicthesis.sty}: the style definition to get this
    awesome look and feel. 
    \item\texttt{ClassicThesis.tcp} a \TeX nicCenter project file.
    Great tool and it's free!
    \item\texttt{ClassicThesis.tex}: the main file of your thesis
    where all gets bundled together.
    \item\texttt{classicthesis-ldpkg.sty}: a central place to load all 
    nifty packages that are used. The package has the following options 
    available:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item\texttt{nochapters}, which defaults to \texttt{false}.
		    Activate it if you want to use the package with a class which does
		    not have chapter divisions, \eg, an article.
		    \item\texttt{backref}, which also defaults to \texttt{false}.
		    Activate it if you do want to show in the bibliography on which
		    page(s) each reference was cited. %See page~\pageref{app:bibliography} 
		    for an example of the default setting.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This should get you started in no time.


\section{Style Options}
There are a couple of options for \texttt{classicthesis.sty} that
allow for a bit of freedom concerning the layout:
\begin{itemize}
    \graffito{\dots or your supervisor might use the margins for some
    comments of her own while reading.}
    \item\texttt{drafting}: prints the date and time at the bottom of
    each page, so you always know which version you are dealing with.
    Might come in handy not to give your Prof. that old draft.
    \item\texttt{eulerchapternumbers}: use figures from Hermann Zapf's
    Euler math font for the chapter numbers. By default, old style
    figures from the Palatino font are used.
    \item\texttt{linedheaders}: changes the look of the chapter
    headings a bit by adding a horizontal line above the chapter
    title. The chapter number will also be moved to the top of the
    page, above the chapter title.
    \item\texttt{listsseparated}: will add extra space between table
    and figure entries of different chapters in the list of tables or
    figures, respectively.
    \item\texttt{tocaligned}: aligns the whole table of contents on
    the left side. Some people like that, some don't.
    \item\texttt{subfig}(\texttt{ure}): is passed to the \texttt{tocloft} 
    package to enable compatibility with the \texttt{subfig}(\texttt{ure}) 
    package.
    \item\texttt{nochapters}: allows to use the look-and-feel with 
    classes that do not use chapters, \eg, for articles. Automatically
    turns off a couple of other options: \texttt{eulerchapternumbers}, 
    \texttt{linedheaders}, \texttt{listsseparated}, and \texttt{parts}.
    \item\texttt{beramono}: loads Bera Mono as typewriter font. 
    (Default setting is using the standard CM typewriter font.)
    \item\texttt{eulermath}: loads the awesome Euler fonts for math. 
    (Palatino is used as default font.)
    \item\texttt{parts}: if you use Part divisions for your document,
    you should choose this option. It provides you with the command
    \verb|\myPart{}| which takes care of the style and the entry
    into the Table of Contents. (Cannot be used together with
    \texttt{nochapters}.)
    \item\texttt{a5paper}: adjusts the page layout according to the
    global \texttt{a5paper} option (\emph{experimental} feature).
    \item\texttt{minionpro}: sets Robert Slimbach's Minion as the 
    main font of the document. The textblock size is adjusted 
    accordingly. 
    \item\texttt{pdfspacing}: makes use of pdftex' letter spacing
    capabilities via the \texttt{microtype} package.\footnote{Use 
    \texttt{microtype}'s \texttt{DVIoutput} option to generate
    DVI with pdftex.} This fixes some serious issues regarding 
    math formul\ae\ etc. (\eg, ``\ss'') in headers. 
    \item\texttt{minionprospacing}: uses the internal \texttt{textssc}
    command of the \texttt{MinionPro} package for letter spacing. This 
    automatically enables the \texttt{minionpro} option and overrides
    the \texttt{pdfspacing} option.
    \item\texttt{dottedtoc}: sets pagenumbers flushed right in the 
    table of contents.
    \item\texttt{listings}: loads the \texttt{listings} package (if not 
    already done) and configures the List of Listings accordingly.
    \item\texttt{manychapters}: if you need more than nine chapters for 
    your document, you might not be happy with the spacing between the 
    chapter number and the chapter title in the Table of Contents. 
    This option allows for additional space in this context. 
    However, it does not look as ``perfect'' if you use
    \verb|\parts| for structuring your document.
\end{itemize}
The best way to figure these options out is to try the different
possibilities and see, what you and your supervisor like best.

To make things in general easier, \texttt{classicthesis-ldpkg.sty} 
contains some useful commands that might help you.


\section{Future Work}
So far, this is a quite stable version that served a couple of people
well during their thesis time. However, some things are still not as
they should be. Proper documentation in the standard format is still
missing. In the long run, the style should probably be published
separately, with the template bundle being only an application of the
style. Alas, there is no time for that at the moment\dots it could be
a nice task for a small group of \LaTeX nicians.

Please do not send me email with questions concerning \LaTeX\ or the
template, as I do not have time for an answer. But if you have
comments, suggestions, or improvements for the style or the template
in general, do not hesitate to write them on that postcard of yours.

\section{Beyond a Thesis}
It is easy to use the layout of \texttt{classicthesis.sty} without the
framework of this bundle. To make it even easier, this section offers 
some plug-and-play-examples.

The \LaTeX -sources of these examples can be found in the folder 
with the name \texttt{Examples}. They have been tested with  
\texttt{latex} and \texttt{pdflatex} and are easy to compile. To 
assure you even a bit more, PDFs built from the sources can also 
be found the folder. 
%(It might be necessary to adjust the path to 
%\texttt{classicthesis.sty} and \texttt{Bibliography.bib} within the 
%examples.)
