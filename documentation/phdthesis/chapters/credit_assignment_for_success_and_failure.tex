\section{Failure in Expected Results}

When a symbolic reference to a physical activity is actualized in the
context of a plan, the causal model predicts expected symbolic
physical perceptions, goals, and failures.

\section{First-order Reflective Goals and Failures}

First-order reflective activity creates, forgets, and manipulates
causal models of physical activities.  Physical goals and failures are
the initial first-order reflective activity that causes the creation
of physical causal models, combining these causal models into larger
structures called plans.  First-order reflective goals and failures
are a fundamentally different class of goal and failure from the
physical class of goal and failure.  While physical goals and failures
serve to preferentially organize symbolic physical perceptions and
resources, first-order reflective goals and failures serve to
preferentially organize first-order reflective plan perceptions and
planning resources.

\section{First-order Reflective Causal Hypotheses}

First-order reflective goals and failures are the reason for the
creation of first-order reflective causal models.
