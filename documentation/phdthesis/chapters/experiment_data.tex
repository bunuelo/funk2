This appendix chapter includes empirical data gathered using the
reflective tracing features of the underlying Funk garbage collected
memory system, upon which the virtual operating system is built.  This
low level memory tracing functionality allows easily tracing events at
any level of abstraction in the entire system using the Funk causal
reflective tracing features.  \autoref{table:reflective_learning}
shows a list of figures showing data from an experiment with the AI
reflectively tracing, and building models of the deliberative planning
process.  \autoref{table:no_reflective_learning} shows a list of
figures showing data from an experiment with the reflective learning
disabled.
