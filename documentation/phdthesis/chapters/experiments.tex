\section{A Demonstration in a Social Commonsense Reasoning Domain}

The goal of our project is to build a demo of part of Minsky's
architecture, and the domain of commonsense reasoning in a kitchen is
I feel the right way to develop those high-level theories.

We tested our cognitive architecture learning in the context of a
social commonsense reasoning domain with parents that teach children
as they attempt to accomplish cooking tasks in a kitchen.  Kitchens
are a good example of a rich learning environment for children
\cite{dewey:1907}.  Kitchens are ubiquitous across cultures.  They
have a clear production goal, food.  They involve many many mental
realms: math, physics, chemistry, thermodynamics, natural language,
social, family, imprimer learning, children, parents, concurrent
planning, etc.
