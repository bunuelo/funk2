\label{section:model_6_future_research}

I began discussing strong parallels between my model and Minsky's
six-layered reflective theory of mind, called The Emotion Machine or
Model-6, in \autoref{backreference:self_reflective_self_conscious}.
Now I will continue a description of the top two layers of Minsky's
model in the theoretical terms of my model.

\section{Objective Reflection}
\label{section:objective_reflection}

Viewing the physical activities as physical objects is future research
for my model.  Thinking about physical objects and their relationships
is absolutely compatible with the theory that I have described in this
dissertation.  This creation of subjective perspectives by my model
can be superficially confused for an absurd philosophy called
``Subjective Idealism'', which I treat in
\autoref{section:the_category_mistake_of_subjective_idealism}.

The ability to abstract object and subject distinctions within the
mind is key to how I see the creation of selves.  The primary object
abstractions would necessarily be based on physical activities that
lead toward or against physical goals.  An object has subjective
perspectives and extents in Space.  Further, every subjective
perspective would usefully have a set of causal hypotheses that lead
to and away from the object's more central subjective perspectives.
Objects, therefore, become collections of subjective perspectives that
can be easily traversed given the included causal models.  The extent
of an object in Space gives a useful Spatial arrangement for causal
hypotheses that help to create controllable boundaries around similar
perceptual and goal activities.

For example, this makes sense from a survivability standpoint.  The
most important and the first subject and object distinctions are those
that help accomplish or avoid physical goals.  In creating the
distinction that allows the mind to see the physical body as subjected
to the objects of a physical world, the mind has created one of the
first subjective perspectives, the physical body.

\section{Circular Objects}

Causal hypotheses are used in order to predict the future occurrence
of symbolic perceptions and goals.  Through reflective thinking, plans
are constructed from causal hypotheses consistent with the past,
elaborating the necessities in the past and the results in the future.
Analogies between consistent plans can be abstracted into models of
objects.  For example, a plan that begins and ends with the same
symbolic perception could be considered an example of a ``circular''
object; thus, an analogical plan abstraction would represent a type of
object, that has multiple sides to perceive depending on the subject's
position in the plan.  Circular objects may be an important type of
object to analogically recognize because a circular object allows one
to perform actions while being able to get back to a known perceptual
symbol.  If one is in a known circular object, then one is not lost in
the sense that one can always follow the circle in order to get back
to any perceptual symbol contained within the circular plan object.
My implementation includes tools for performing analogical
abstractions and constructions of plans, but this machinery is not key
to my thesis of explaining causal reflective learning to accomplish
goals.  I include this section in the dissertation to eliminate a
potential confusion that would conflate the concept of symbol with
that of object.  Symbols are the most primitive elements available to
thinking, while objects are more complicated in that they are composed
of analogical consistencies between plans that are themselves composed
of many symbols.  Objects have multiple subjective perspectives.
Objects are artificial creations of a mind, based on artificial static
symbols representing the ongoing activity in Duration.

\section{Body and World}

An intelligent mind builds models that predict the occurrence of
perceptual symbols.  Analogical thinking is used to abstract objects
and simultaneously the implied subjective perspectives on these
objects as they are manipulated.  The separation between the physical
body and the physical world is an objective form of thinking that is
fundamentally caused by goals that emphasize distinguishing bodily and
worldly goals in the causal structures of the physical perceptions.
For example, physical actions that change physical perceptions in
predictable ways are often bodily physical perceptions, i.e. moving
ones hand in front of ones face causes one to consistently see a hand.
Also, physical pain perceptions could be related to physical goals
that emphasize the artificial separation between the body and the
world.  Understanding the artificial separation of the body and the
world allows for an objective form of scientific study that places the
object of study in the world outside of the effects of the body.

\section{$m^\text{th}$-Stratum Objective Reflection}

Above this ability to model multiple interacting objects is the
ability to model objects as containing objects of the self-same type.
The ability to abstract all of the layers of a reflective mind into
one type of object or another can be used to recursively model one
object's model of another object.  Therefore, although my model does
not include objective reflection, I see this form of reflection as
along a new dimension that has, as its origin, all of the reflective
layers that I have so far described in my model.  I will refer to this
new dimension as ordered \emph{strata} of the \emph{objective
  dimension of reflective thinking}.

\begin{align}
\label{equation:objective_0_reflective_stratum}
\text{objective}^0\text{ reflective stratum } &{\approx} \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{\text{reflective}^n\text{ layer}} \\
\label{equation:objective_m_reflective_stratum}
\text{objective}^m\text{ reflective stratum } &{\approx} \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{\text{objective}^m\text{ reflective}^n\text{ layer}}
\end{align}

Prior to the first objective thinking stratum existing, it must have a
prior part of the mind upon which to objectively reflect.  I will
refer to all of the reflective layers I've described so far as the
zeroth-stratum of objective thinking, the ``$\text{objective}^0$''
stratum, since it contains no objective thinking at all.  Therefore,
the $m^\text{th}$-stratum of objective thinking in my model can be
described as ``$\text{objective}^m$'' reflective thinking.  Given this
notation, the self-reflective layer of Minsky's model would be the
first-stratum of objective thinking, or $\text{objective}^1$ reflection,
in my model.  Each $\text{objective}^m$ reflective stratum in my model
contains an infinite number of $\text{objective}^m\text{ reflective}^n$
layers.
Equations~\ref{equation:objective_0_reflective_stratum}~and~\ref{equation:objective_m_reflective_stratum},
roughly and non-mathematically show how each objective thinking
stratum is composed of an infinite number of reflective layers.
Again, this notation is \emph{not} set theoretic, and thus, set
theoretical mathematics do not apply.

\begin{figure}[bth]
  \begin{align*}
    \left.
    \begin{array}{l}
      \text{Minsky's Problem Domain }\\

      \text{Minsky's Deliberative Layer }\\
      \text{Minsky's Reflective Layer }\\
    \end{array}
    \right\}                               &{\approx} \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{\text{objective}^0\text{ reflective}^n\text{ layer}} \\
                                           &{\approx} \text{ objective}^0\text{ reflective stratum} \\
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align*}
    \text{Minsky's Self-Reflective Layer } &{\approx} \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{\text{objective}^1\text{ reflective}^n\text{ layer}} \\
                                           &{\approx} \text{ objective}^1\text{ reflective stratum} \\
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align*}
    \text{Minsky's Self-Conscious Layer }  &{\approx} \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{\text{objective}^2\text{ reflective}^n\text{ layer}} \\
                                           &{\approx} \text{ objective}^2\text{ reflective stratum}
  \end{align*}
\caption{The top layers of Model-6 roughly mapped to my
  $\text{objective}^m\text{ reflective}^n$ stratum notation.}
\label{figure:model_6_as_reflective_stratum_notation}
\end{figure}

Minsky's ``self-conscious'' layer would thereby roughly correspond
with my $\text{objective}^2$ reflective stratum.  Having two levels of
recursion in a objective thinking sense, leads to the ability to
represent what one object references in terms of what another object
references in terms of the original object.
\autoref{figure:model_6_as_reflective_stratum_notation} shows roughly
how the levels of Minsky's theory can be related to my stratum
notation.

\section{Imprimers}

\cite{minsky:2006} explains that terms like ``guilt'' and ``pride''
can refer to self-conscious ways of thinking.  Minsky hypothesizes
that there are powerful ways of thinking that result when someone whom
one respects, like a parent, values or devalues their goals.  This
type of relationship between object models is named an \emph{imprimer
  relationship} by Minsky.  In this relationship, the parent plays the
role of what Minsky has named an \emph{imprimer}, in reference to the
ability of ducklings to learn, relatively arbitrarily, to trust and
follow a parent-like figure.  Since I do not know of a another word
for an object in this sort of imprinting relationship, I will simply
use Minsky's term: imprimer.  He hypothesizes that imprimers, such as
parents and caregivers, play an important role in unquestioned
knowledge inheritance in children.  This type of thinking about what
someone else is thinking about their goals requires at least two
strata of objective reflection in my model.
