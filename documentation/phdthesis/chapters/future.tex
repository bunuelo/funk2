\section{Panalogy Architecture}



\subsection{Recursive Loops and Infinite Recursive Tracing Descent}

If the focus on the tracing is controlled carefully, these potential
loops can be avoided.  How to detect and control these potential loops
is an interesting area of future automatic debugging research in
reflective control.

\subsection{Potential Future Uses for Low-Level Tracing}

Lower level objects maybe be interesting to focus on for research in
automatic abstraction and simulation of system components.  Optimizing
compilers could benefit from this area of future research.  E.g.
focusing on the CPU object could help to develop better run-time
register allocation models.

\subsection{Why Should You Use This Radically New Language?}

Because the language is very similar to Lisp, it has proven to be easy
for both expert and novice programmers to learn.  This has been my
experience with the four undergraduates that have worked within the
language, who learned it quickly, started writing their own macros to
facilitate their style, and one even made additions to the core
algorithms.

\section{Agent Speech Acts}

At any given point in time, each agent is pursuing a different variety
of goals.  Each agent executes actions in order to accomplish
collections of these goals.  We treat language communication as an
additional physical action that the agent can choose to perform in
order to accomplish its goals.

\section{Modelling Noise in Agent Communication}

\end{figure}

Our cognitive theory makes no statements as to the presence of noise
in communication channels between agents and the environment.
Communication between agents and the environment in our implementation
occurs across a noiseless communication channel.  It is theoretically
possible to include a theory of noisy communication channels between
agents and the environment.  For example, Shannon's mathmematical
theory of communication~\citep{shannon:1959} could be applied as an
elaboration to any of the information pathways in our basic theory.

\section{Applications to Education and Mental Health}

An exciting new field is growing to include applications of cognitive
theories of mind to both educational and clinical mental health
domains.  For example, \cite{mahncke:2006} have reported results of
improved cognitive function by using an automated computer cognitive
training program targeting age-related cognitive decline.



\section{A Simple Overview}

We are focusing on how humans are capable of learning and teaching one
another to exhibit virtuous behavior. Humans are able to learn from
each other, not just simple actions but entire systems of morality and
values. What are the factors that mitigate goal learning? What are the
differences between guilt, shame, regret? Are these different or just
different words? Is shame fundamentally social? Guilt and shame are
common in folk psychology, but they are too poorly understood to
scientifically study the details of their specific mechanisms.

Let our working definition of virtuous behavior be the complexities of
accomplishing and maintaining social goals, which in our model are
initially learned from interactions with the physical world in the
context of parents. We are attempting to understand how different
forms of cooperative and non-cooperative behavior develop in these
situations. We are also interested in how an observant parent can
guide the development of these behaviors in children.

So, what is a simple way to begin to talk about what we mean by
"social thinking" and "moral thinking"? In the past, these topics have
spawned numerous approaches that are more or less representative of
our biological understanding. Some approaches have been formalized
into computational models that can be used as working scientific
theories. Recently, all of these initial approaches have been extended
and further researched so that we can calculate probability
distributions over these representations. We can now categorize these
approaches. A categorization reveals the diversity of human thought
covered by different approaches. We are interested in understanding
what types of processes are most important to describe when we
approach the extremely complicated issue of moral reasoning.

\section{Philosophy and Related Research}

\subsection{The Social Utility of Moral Reasoning}

When we approach the topic of immorality, there are many complicating
factors, so how can we simplify the reality of the situation in order
to create a model, which is necessarily not real, but which is still
useful for predicting reality? Well, we currently see many approaches
to studying different aspects of moral reasoning, such as how moral
judgements are dependent on the causal structure of how a person
understands social coersion [1]. We also see evidence that engaging
emotions such as "pride", "embarrassment", and "regret" has been shown
to be correlated to specific fMRI BOLD patterns [2]. Further, lines
have been drawn between mere chauvinism for one's own social group and
the more complicating aspects of virtuous behavior that maximizes
social utility [3]. This gives us initial evidence and philosophical
guidance to pursue better models for what we mean by virtuous
behavior.

\subsection{Current Models}

The field of machine learning has described models of goal-oriented
behavior that use a numerical utility function in order to quantify
whether or not a given goal has been accomplished. These models are
proving useful for finding the beginning of an explanation for how
models of the world are learned and what the function of specific
neurotransmitters may be in the neocortex [4]. The problem with these
simple propositional goal-oriented models is that they cannot handle
the large state spaces involved in modelling social relationships and
social goals, so we need something slightly more complicated. A
popular tool for modelling situations involving people thinking about
the goals of other people is the tool of relational representations,
e.g., the modal logics of morality [5]. Augmenting goal-oriented
reinforcement learning models with the abilities of relational
representations is a being done by a relatively young field [6] that
is proving to be maturing very quickly.

\subsection{The Development of Social Goals}

If we are going to develop a theory of virtuous behavior, or social
goals, how do we begin to model the cooperative and non-cooperative
thought processes that would constitute working toward or against
other people? It has been shown that the neural circuits that are
involved in how someone thinks about what someone else knows are
largely distinct from the circuits involved in perceptual capabilities
[7]. There have also been distinctions shown between the neural
circuits involved in how someone thinks about what someone else knows
and executive control of actions [8]. There is good reason to believe
that the learning of social behavior is bootstrapped from learning
causal physical models [9].

\section{Our Ongoing Research}

\subsubsection{A Reflective Parallel Programming Language}

We have written a programming language, called Funk2, [10] that allows
us to easily build and monitor the execution of our model. Our
language allows describing systems that reflectively trace changes to
collections of knowledge by many different parallel mental
processes. Procedural reflection is a computational technique that we
have built into this language that is useful for organizing models
that monitor and control their own execution [11]. We have chosen to
write our own language because most other programming languages
emphasize the idea of abstraction barriers, which allows writing
optimized code, but which does not allow a user to access the details
of an execution environment. Our language allows itself to access many
of the details of its own process execution by emphasizing "execution
simplicity" over "speed optimization" in many cases. Most programming
languages are optimized for speed at the expense of the resulting
complexity of the optimized processes and also the lack of traces of
reflectively useful execution events. Our language is useful for
building models of processes that monitor, control, and change other
concurrently executing processes. We see this as a very useful tool
for modelling the complex types of interactions between learning
processes that are described in the cognitive sciences. In other
words, the form of procedural reflection enabled by our language gives
us a powerful method for organizing models of parallel learning
processes.

\subsubsection{A Physically Grounded Social Problem Domain}

Figure 1: The IsisWorld simulation, a project developed and maintained
by Dustin Smith, is a rigid-body physics simulation that is capable of
handling semantic commonsense objects and actions involved in kitchen
cooking tasks.  In order to help us define a grounded problem domain,
we have chosen to focus on a rigid-body physical simulation of parents
and children in the context of basic cooking tasks in a kitchen
environment. We chose parents and children because we feel that major
parts of social and moral learning develops during early stages
involving these familiar social relationships. We chose the domain of
basic kitchen cooking tasks because this is a non-trivial social
commonsense reasoning domain that exists in some form in all human
cultures. Our physical simulation is called IsisWorld, and a
screenshot is shown in Figure 1.

\subsubsection{A Simple Social Reasoning Model}

\subsubsection{Physical Reactions}

Our cognitive model is organized into layers. The lowest layer
represents the simplest processes of thinking, such as physical
reflexes, e.g., "I jerk my hand away from the stove if I burn my
fingers." The next layer represents processes that have been practiced
successfully very often, and which one does not think about, e.g., "My
legs go through fixed action patterns if I want to walk across the
room."

\subsubsection{The Past, Goals, and Deliberative Thinking}

Next, at a slightly higher layer in our model, we begin to model
deliberative thinking, which allows one to use memories of the past
and imaginative memories of the future in order to make plans for
doing things that one has perhaps never done before. For example, if
one wants to rescue a cat from being caught in a tree, maybe one has
played with cats in the past as well as climbed trees, but one has
never done the two at the same time. This would be a form of
deliberative thinking, making something like a plan for a goal that
one has never exactly done before. If a plan for accomplishing a
deliberate goal is successful, perhaps this successful process could
be compiled down into a lower level layer, so that it does not need to
again be thought of deliberatively.

\subsubsection{Causal Abstractions and Reflective Thinking}

Now, we have so far only discussed the types of thought processes that
solve problems based on perceptions of problems in the physical
world. For example, the processes that reflexively jerk one's hand
from a stove, are due to corpuscles in the fingers communicating
information to neurons about burning temperatures in the skin of the
hand. Further, the learned walking process receives proprioceptive
information about the relative angles of the person's limbs, as well
as somatosensory information about the pressure on the soles of the
feet, as well as vestibular information about the accelleration forces
on the head, including gravity. Walking is a very complicated process,
but walking is primarily a physical control problem. Now, we are going
to introduce a separate perceptual stream of information that does not
describe the physical state of the body in the world. This separate
perceptual stream, refers to the interactions between the parallel
mental processes. We can distinguish between these two types of
perceptual streams, by calling one type a Physical perceptual stream
and the other we can call a Reflective perceptual stream of
information.

Figure 2: Two perceptual streams, one from the physical world and
another from reflecting on the relationships between mental processes,
are correlated and induced into intentional causal models.  Now, once
we have a reflective perceptual stream that represents the reflective
state of the mind, we can begin to model processes of reflective
thinking that solve problems in this reflective state space. For
example, a reflective process could remember what deliberative
processes are good for making different types of plans to handle
different types of physical problems, such as the differences that
must be considered between moving physical objects that display agency
as opposed to physical objects that do not exhibit any form of
agency. Once we have made a distinction in our model between physical
perceptions and reflective perceptions, we correlate these two
streams, which allows us to infer reflective events from physical
events. Figure 2 emphasizes that the correlation of these two
perceptual streams can be used to induce abstractions that causally
relate reflective events to physical events.

\subsubsection{The Self/Other Distinction and Self-Reflective Thinking}

If our mental model contains knowledge of the correlations between a
physical perceptual stream and a reflective perceptual stream, then
the agent can use these correlations to predict the reflective states
of other agents based purely on their physical actions. For example,
if one agent performs a series of physical actions in order to
accomplish a goal, such as preparing a slice of buttered toast using a
knife and a loaf of bread and some butter in a kitchen, then these
actions have been correlated with this agent's reflective states,
including the current goals that the agent is pursuing. If this agent
then sees the physical world changing, and he knows that he is not
causing those changes, then he can attempt to infer the state of mind
of another agent. This type of inference process, based on the
previous correlations of physical and reflective perceptual streams,
is what we refer to as a self-reflective thought process. A
self-reflective thought process introduces the social distinction
between Self and Other reflective state knowledge that is inferred by
using the previously learned correlations between physical perceptions
and reflective perceptions. We refer to this type of self-reflective
knowledge as "singly recursive" reflective knowledge, or "thinking
about what someone else is thinking about". Sometimes this singly
recursive reflective knowledge is referred to as "theory of mind"
knowledge in the cognitive science literature.

With self-reflective knowlege, an agent can choose to act
altruistically by helping another agent accomplish their goals or
maliciously by working against their goals. However, there is the
possibility that an agent is not always running a self-reflective
process that pays attention to another agent's physical actions in
order to infer what their goals might be. In many cases, such as in
our simulation of parents and children in a kitchen, some agents might
focus single-mindedly on a novel task without thinking about what the
goals of surrounding agents might be. This type of model allows for an
agent that works against the goals of another agent without knowing
the goals of the other agent. One might argue that this type of
situation where one agent clobbers the goals of another agent is due
to a form of self-reflective laziness and not due to malicious
intentions.

\subsubsection{Guilt, Pride, and Self-Conscious Thinking}

Because we are interested in modelling how children learn from parents
as well as how parents guide a child's cooperative behavior, we need
to extend our model slightly in order to allow for modelling what one
agent thinks about what another agent thinks about her. This form of
double reflective recursion is what we refer to as a self-conscious
knowledge and the problems that are represented in this type of
knowledge are handled by what we call self-conscious thought
processes. For example, a little boy may be cooking something in the
kitchen and he may carelessly work against the goals of his sister;
this situation may be recognized by an onlooking parent, and the
parent may inform the boy of a self-reflective mistake he has made:
"Ralph, your sister was going to use some of that butter that you just
finished." The little boy, Ralph in this case, thinks that his mother
thinks that he made a self-reflective mistake. We hypothesize that
modelling this form of double reflective recursion in conjunction with
respectful social relationships may be useful for understanding
emotions such as guilt and pride. We have focused our model of
children learning to cooperate in the context of parents on this sort
of self-conscious learning feedback.

\subsection{A Six Layer Organization of Our Model}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Self-Conscious Thinking: processes that manipulate doubly recursive reflective representations.}
\item{Self-Reflective Thinking: processes that manipulate singly recursive reflective representations.}
\item{Reflective Thinking: processes that manipulate representations about one's own mind.}
\item{Deliberative Thinking: processes that manipulate representations of the physical world.}
\item{Learned Reactive Thinking: processes that have been learned and chunked for efficient execution.}
\item{Built-In Reactive Thinking: processes that are given as the simplest and lowest-level aspects of the mental model.}
\end{itemize}

Figure 3: A layered reflective model of mind inspired by Marvin
Minsky's Model-6 Emotion Machine theory of how humans perform
commonsense human thinking [12].  In summary, the control structure in
our model can be thought of simply as being roughly organized into six
layers of control, which is shown in Figure 3. The bottom layer
represents the physical reactive interface to the physical world. Both
perception and action are inputs and outputs from this layer,
respectively. Then, at each subsequently higher layer information from
below and above are processed as we have described in the previous
sections, leading to changes in self-reflective processes caused by
self-conscious learning as our highest level example.
