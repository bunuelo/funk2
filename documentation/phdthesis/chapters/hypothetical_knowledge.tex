\section{Hypothesis}

I have previously described grounded factual knowledge that has an
unquestionable basis in symbolic perceptions.  Now, I will describe
how hypothetical causal models are abstracted from this factual
knowledge in order to create counterfactual knowledge, which keeps
this factual references so that it can be debugged when it is wrong.

\section{Causal Knowledge}

Now that a separate temporal sequence for each reflective layer has
been defined, this factual grounded knowledge can be abstracted into
hypothetical causal models that are useful for planning toward goals
in a counterfactual future.



{\mbox{\autoref{figure:example_causal_knowledge}}} shows an example of
causal knowledge.

  knowledge, $\text{\tt{knowledge}}_1^*$, where the simultaneity,
  $\text{\tt{simult}}_7^*$, is known to be the cause of the
  transframe, $\text{\tt{transition}}_2^*$.  Negative perceptions are
  omitted here for to reduce visual clutter.}

\section{Representing Causal Hypotheses}

{\mbox{\autoref{figure:example_causal_hypothesis}}} shows an example
of a causal hypothesis, $h_1^*$, where the simultaneity,
$\text{\tt{simult}}_7^*$, is hypothesized to be the cause of the
transframe, $\text{\tt{transframe}}_2^*$.  In other words, the gripper
dropping the block causes the block to be sitting on the table.
