\section{Sequential Execution}

First-order reflective thinking creates causal hypotheses that
describe how physical resources cause transitions between perceptions
and goals.  Additional first-order reflective thinking activities
combine these causal hypotheses into plans that are supposed to
accomplish or avoid goals, given their preferential arrangement.
After a plan is created, its sequential causal models can be traversed
and the causal resource referenced can be activated.  I will refer to
this sequential process of traversing through a plan as
\emph{execution}.
