\section{Build a Reflective Knowledge Substrate}

The assumption that we introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:introducing_reflection_early_in_the_process},
``Introducing Reflection Early in the Process'', requires that changes
in our knowledge representation can be traced and compiled into other
representations, such as the reflective event representations used in
learning to accomplish goals.

\subsection{General Parallelism and Concurrency}

Because the procedurally reflective programming paradigm focuses on
event streams of changes to memory, there is an inherent ability to
express procedurally reflective algorithms in a streaming parallel
language.

Figure~\ref{fig:concurrent_parallel_reflection_efficiency} shows how a
simple process can be reflectively monitored without slowing down the
fundamental process by more than the constant time factor necessary
for generating the event stream.  Many different parallel reflective
processes can be reflectively processing concurrently without any
additional slowdown in the primary problem solving process.

\subsection{Program as Data}

The ability for a process to manipulate a program as data makes it
easier for that process or a user to read, edit, and write programs as
they are debugged.
