In order to demonstrate my solution to the problem of reflectively
learning-to-control, my examples will be within the physical block
building domain shown in \autoref{figure:an_example_problem_domain}.

\section{The Physical Knowledge-Base}

The block building domain is a simulation based on two-dimensional
ridid-body physical laws, including floating point numerical
representations for object positions, velocities and accellerations.
These numerical representations and the processes that manipulate them
are part of the $\text{reflective}^0$ physical layer of the model, but
in order to focus the efficiency of the procedural reflection, a much
simpler relational graph representation has been specifically
represented in semantic frame-based objects in a semantic
knowledge-base, referred to as the \emph{physical knowledge-base}.
The physical knowledge-base includes objects with shapes, colors, and
multiple prepositional spatial relationships.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:implemented_physical_knowledge}}} shows the
physical knowledge-base.

\section{An Example Storyboard}

{\mbox{\autoref{figure:implemented_example_learning_storyboard}}}
shows a storyboard of the implemented example of second-order
learning.

\caption[A storyboard of the implemented example of second-order
  learning.]{A storyboarded example of second-order learning, where
  the goal is to create a stack of two blocks.  (1) A plan that is
  hypothesized to stack the square block on top of the triangular
  block is executed.  (2--8) The plan completes execution and results
  in the square falling off of the triangle, an expectation failure.
  (9) The second-order hypothetical heuristic is learned that predicts
  plan failure will result by executing plans that try to stack
  squares on top of triangles.  A plan that is hypothesized to stack
  the triangle on top of the square is executed.  (9-12) The second
  plan completes execution, accomplishing the physical goal.}
