\chapter{The Real Process}\label{ch:the_real_process}
%************************************************

In this dissertation I will describe a reasoning process for
reflectively learning to accomplish goals.  I will not attempt to give
a complete description of a general problem domain nor a complete
description of a general problem solver.  My work here leaves the
unmodellable aspects of reality as known to be just that.  The process
of reasoning includes using models as useful tools of thought with the
clear understanding that these models are not real.  Here I will focus
on a positive description of the real processes of being, perceiving,
acting, abstracting, making decisions, and reflectively thinking about
the causal results of those decisions.  While I will give examples in
terms of a working model implementation of the real processes that I
am attempting to describe, I will not confuse the clear black and
white lines that are necessary in building such an implementation with
the reality of my focus which I have chosen to be categorized in this
way as exemplary of such a process.
