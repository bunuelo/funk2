\chapter{Virtual Machine and Programming Language}
\label{chapter:virtual_machine_and_programming_language}

The SALS AI is a cognitive architecture that is constructed on a
virtual machine and low-level Lisp-like programming language that
implicitly supports the tracing of results and behavior of the system
to the data and through the procedures that produced those results and
that behavior \cite[]{morgan:2009}.  Good traces make a system
accountable and help to enable the analysis of success and failure,
and thus enhancing the ability of the system to learn from mistakes.
The low-level Lisp-like programming language is not to be confused
with the high-level natural programming language presented in
{\mbox{\autoref{chapter:learning_from_being_told_natural_language_plans}}},
where I have described many of the high-level natural language
interpretation and imagination failures that the SALS AI is able to
detect and avoid through backtracking.  In this chapter, I will focus
on the details of the low-level Lisp-like programming language that
enable those types of backtracking and failure avoidance.  In
{\mbox{\autoref{chapter:learning_asynchronously_from_experience}}}, I
described the details of how an asynchronous learning algorithm can
learn from these failures so that these failures can be avoided in
future natural language plan executions through learning refined
causal models of the hypothetical imagined effects of natural language
plans.  In this chapter, I will describe the details of the low-level
Lisp-like language that enable these types of asynchronous learning
algorithms.  The SALS virtual machine provides for general parallelism
and concurrency, while supporting the automatic collection of audit
trails for all processes, including the processes that analyze audit
trails.  The native support of a low-level Lisp-like language in the
SALS architecture allows, as in machine language, a program to be data
that can be easily manipulated by a program, making it easier for a
user or an automatic procedure to read, edit, and write programs as
they are debugged.  Large concurrent and parallel systems are often
difficult to build and debug because of the complex causal
interactions between all of the different processes.  For this reason,
every parallel task in SALS has an associated ``cause'' object.  If
any task creates a new parallel task, then a new cause object is
created for the child task with a parent cause object reference.
Cause objects represent meta-information about a task, such as in what
way a compiled procedure should be executed, which can be used for
causally organizing the effects of groups of parallel tasks,
controlling and monitoring the occurrence of any type of event through
any of the procedural abstraction barriers of the SALS virtual
machine.

\section{Virtual Machine}

The SALS virtual machine is designed to take advantage of the next
generation of multithreaded and multicore CPUs, so that new reflective
algorithms will more easily be designed to exhibit ``strong'' scaling
properties \cite[]{sodan:2010}.  In order to allow the development of
these new types of algorithms, the SALS virtual machine includes an
explicit representation, called a ``virtual processor'' object, that
represents each hyperthread in each core of each CPU in the target
hardware platform.  Each of the SALS virtual processors is used in
order to organize the scheduling of SALS ``fiber'' objects, which are
the bytecode threads that execute in the SALS virtual machine.  In
this way, each SALS fiber can be assigned to a specific hyperthread in
the target hardware platform.  In order to prevent local cache misses
for on-chip caches, the SALS virtual machine has a separate memory
pool allocated for each of the SALS virtual processors.  So, for CPUs
that has 4 cores and 2 hyperthreads per core, 8 memory pools are
allocated when the SALS virtual machine is created.  Also, a major
bottleneck in systems with large numbers of processors and cores are
mutual exclusion or ``mutex'' locks that protect shared resources.
The SALS virtual machine avoids all mutexes in the memory layer by
using these separate dedicated memory pools for each hyperthread in
each CPU core for memory allocation and concurrent garbage collection.
Mutexes are provided in the SALS architecture but low-level memory
allocation and collection can operate at full-speed without any mutex
locks for low-level memory operations.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:cpu_core_hyperthread_distances}}} shows an
example of how SALS allocates virtual processors for a hardware
configuration with two processors, each having four cores and each
core having two hyperthreads.  Each hyperthread is organized into a
binary tree structure that is used in order to calculate distances
between hardware hyperthreads.  This binary tree distance metric is
used to dynamically distribute fiber loads across hyperthreaded CPU
cores in order to attempt to utilize as much on-chip CPU cache as
possible.

  hardware hyperthreads.  This binary tree distance metric is used to

The SALS virtual machine has been tested with a maximum of 32
processors and 128 gigabytes of RAM on the Nautilus supercomputer at
the National Institute for Computational Sciences.  However, most of
the examples presented in this dissertation have been executed on a
personal computer with only 4 CPU cores and 2 hyperthreads per core.
The SALS virtual machine has a tricolor garbage collection algorithm
that takes advantage of parallelizing work in concurrent processors.
Memory pointers in the SALS memory system are 64-bit integers that
have space reserved for three hierarchical memory tiers: (1)
``computer identity,'' (2) ``pool index,'' (3) and ``block address.''
{\mbox{\autoref{table:sals_memory_pointer}}} shows the bit allocation
within the 64-bit SALS memory pointer.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\emph{bit range} &\emph{\# of values} &\emph{memory tier name} \\
\hline
~1 -- 17 &$131,072$         &computer identity \\ % 17

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption[Bit allocation within the SALS memory pointer.]{Bit

\label{table:sals_memory_pointer}
\end{table}
The computer identity is zero if the memory pointer is referencing
memory on the local computer.  The computer identity is an integer
greater than zero if the memory is on another computer that has
connected to the SALS memory system through a low-level peer-to-peer
socket connection.  The ability of the SALS architecture to connect to
other running SALS architectures allows it to potentially scale to
take advantage of the hardware on multiple networked computers to
solve one large shared-memory problem.  The pool index is an integer
reference into an array of memory pools on the given computer.  On any
given computer, one memory pool is allocated for each hyperthread in
each CPU core on each CPU.  The block address is an integer that is a
block index into the given memory pool.  A block size of one byte has
been used for the examples presented in this dissertation but larger
block sizes have been tested and can be used if more memory must be
addressed.

\section{Package Manager}

The SALS programming language allows compiling and running computer
programs that consist of many thousands of lines of code.  For
example, the examples presented in this dissertation depend on loading
154 packages, which are composed of over 30,000 lines of code that are
written in the SALS low-level Lisp-like programming language.  The
SALS programming language includes a package manager in order to
organize dependencies within this codebase.  In addition to a
low-level Lisp-like codebase of packages, the SALS virtual machine has
the ability to load packages that contain optimized routines that are
composed of compiled machine code.  Machine code extensions to the
SALS virtual machine are written in the C programming language.  The C
codebase that compiles to this machine code totals over 150,000 lines
of C code.  The following is a declaration of a package definition in
the SALS low-level Lisp-like language that helps to organize these
different types of dependencies within the SALS codebase:
\begin{samepage}
\begin{Verbatim}
  [defpackage semantic_knowledge_base
    :packages          [equals_hash
                        forgetful_event_stream
                        semantic_realm
                        semantic_causal_event
                        semantic_relationship_key
                        semantic_frame
                        semantic_object
                        semantic_event]
    :sources           ['semantic_knowledge_base-core.sals']
    :dynamic_libraries ['libf2e_semantic_knowledge_base.so']]
\end{Verbatim}
\end{samepage}
The ``defpackage'' expression in the SALS programming language means
``define package.''  The first argument to the defpackage expression
is the name of the package to be defined, ``semantic knowledge base''
in this case.  The remaining arguments to the defpackage expression
are optional and three such arguments are shown in this example: (1)
``packages,'' (2) ``sources,'' and (3) ``dynamic libraries.''  The
``packages'' optional argument specifies a list of other packages that
must be loaded before this package is loaded.  The ``sources''
optional argument specifies a list of SALS low-level Lisp-like
programming language files that are to be loaded when this package is
loaded.  The ``dynamic libraries'' optional argument specifies a list
of files that contain machine code extensions that should be loaded
into the SALS virtual machine when this package is loaded.

Every package and machine code extension to the SALS virtual machine
and programming language performs ``causal reflective tracing'' on
each concurrently executing process.  The following sections describe
examples of different uses of the causal reflective tracing features
that have been implemented throughout the SALS virtual machine and its
extensions.  At the end of this chapter I will describe one high-level
package in the SALS programming language that performs the conjunctive
hypothesis space version space rule-learning algorithm, which is key
to the asynchronous experiential learning presented in
{\mbox{\autoref{chapter:learning_asynchronously_from_experience}}}.

\section{Causal Reflective Tracing}

Parallel tasks in the virtual machine are called ``fibers'' in order
to distinguish them from the ``threads'' in the underlying operating
system kernel.  The parallel fibers create, mutate, and read from
memory as they execute sequences of compiled bytecodes.  At any point
between bytecode executions, the memory system is static and can be
saved or loaded from non-volatile memory, such as a harddisk.  The
current execution state of every fiber is represented in the global
environment.  To be fully reflective on all of the procedural effects
of any given fiber, I introduce a technique called ``causal reflective
tracing.''  Causal reflective tracing is a way of defining variables
that are specific to each fiber that can be used to control the
low-level memory access, mutation, and creation functions.  This
allows one fiber to subscribe to the procedural trace events of
another fiber without receiving procedural trace events of its own
execution, which would lead to an infinite regress, halting the
system.  Further, because the virtual machine is inherently a parallel
processing system, a given fiber will often start a number of child
fibers that handle part of the processing for the parent fiber.  When
a new fiber is created, the child fiber inherits the causal variable
bindings of its parent fiber, enabling the same procedural tracing
options for the child as well.  So, causal reflective tracing is one
of the basic tools for keeping track of which pieces of memory were
created, mutated, or read by which other fibers.  When evaluating the
theoretical time complexity of concurrent procedurally reflective
control algorithms, it should be noted that creating procedural trace
events for the execution of a given fiber slows the fiber down only by
a constant factor, not affecting the algorithm's ``big-O'' time
complexity on an ideal concurrent shared-memory system, of which the
virtual machine is an approximation.

While causal reflective tracing focuses the procedural event tracing
to memory interactions of specific groups of fibers, this still
results in millions of events to consider every real-time second of
execution.  In order to further focus on specific objects within the
memory system, specific pieces of memory can be created called
``semantic memory.''  Semantic memory objects are created, mutated,
and accessed in roughly the same way as all of the frame-based objects
in the memory system with a few extra reflective tracing features.
For example, semantic objects provide event streams that can be
subscribed to by a number of different parallel listeners in different
fibers.  Also semantic object pointers are bidirectional in order to
ease traversal by reflective pattern matching algorithms.

Because it becomes awkward to subscribe to each an every frame-based
object that may be interesting to the reflective focus, semantic
frames that are created by specific fibers can be added to collections
of semantic frames that are called ``semantic knowledge bases.''
Semantic knowledge bases are good for organizing entire layers or
subsets of reflective layers that contain different types of semantic
frame objects.  Semantic knowledge bases allow the same forgetful
event stream subscription services as semantic frames with the
additional capability of tracing the addition and removal of entire
semantic frames to and from the knowledge base.

While knowledge base reconstructions are extremely fast to reference,
$O(1)$, they require a duplication of the memory requirements of the
focus knowledge base for every different point in time that is
required.  In order to allow efficient access of the state of
knowledge bases at arbitrary points in the past, ``semantic event
knowledge bases'' are another type of representation that is
reflectively and asynchronously maintained in order to not slow down
the primary procedure under reflective focus.  Uses of the event
knowledge base object in the SALS asynchronous learning algorithm have
been described in
{\mbox{\autoref{chapter:learning_asynchronously_from_experience}}}.  I
will briefly review the features of the event knowledge base as well
as a few details about how this object is initialized and used in the
SALS low-level Lisp-like programming language.  The semantic event
knowledge base stores a type of semantic frame called a ``semantic
event.''  A semantic event is a type of semantic frame object that
represents an interval in time, each of which may or may not be
specified, making the interval potentially open-ended.  Semantic event
knowledge bases are reflectively traced and the knowledge is always
stored in two different representations, the basic semantic event
frames as well as a balanced interval tree that always represents the
current state of the semantic event knowledge base.  The balanced
interval tree allows accessing the state of the focus knowledge base
in $O(\log{(n)})$ time, where $n$ is the number of events stored in
the semantic event knowledge base.  Although the time complexity is
not as efficient as the constant, $O(1)$, access time of the
reflectively reconstructed semantic knowledge base, the semantic event
interval tree knowledge base only requires $O(n)$ memory complexity in
order to allow access to the structure of the knowledge base at any
point in the past, where $n$ is the number of semantic events.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:semantic_event_knowledge_base}}} shows how to
create a new ``{\tt{semantic\_event\_knowledge\_base}}'' type object
in the SALS low-level Lisp-like interactive programming language.

  object.  When ``{\tt{semantic\_event}}'' type objects are added,
  removed, or modified while they are in this type of knowledge base,

  structure for all of the events for efficient, $O(\log{(n)})$,
  access to the events at any point in time.}
\label{figure:semantic_event_knowledge_base}
\end{figure}

By default, when there are no listeners to the procedural event
streams of a semantic frame-based object, no reflective events are
created, allowing the use of the object to run at full speed.  When a
listener subscribes to the procedural use of a specific semantic
memory object, events are added to ordered streams for the listening
subscribers.  In order to conserve memory resources, when multiple
parallel listeners are subscribed to a given event stream, only those
events that have not already been seen by all of the subscribers are
remembered.  Once all subscribers have processed an event, all events
before this event are forgotten.  This type of memory conserving event
stream is referred to as a ``forgetful event stream.''  In this way
semantic frames report the addition and removal of slot values to
reflective forgetful event stream subscribers.  Once a knowledge base
is created and we have an important event stream iterator, we can
define a concurrent reflective fiber that processes the events
reflectively, after the real-time execution of the processes that
modify this knowledge base.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:reflective_fiber}}} shows an example of how a
reflective fiber can be created to process an
{\tt{forgetful\_event\_stream}} generated by a
{\tt{semantic\_knowledge\_base}}, which includes a traced
{\tt{semantic\_planner}}.

While every parallel fiber is allocated a unique {\tt{cause}} object
that provides a representation of the reflective tracing features for
that fiber, sometimes it is useful to collect events from a
overlapping sets or different hierarchies of many fiber objects.  A
convenient solution to causally organizing very dynamic sets of fibers
is provided by a ``cause group'' object.  Cause groups are added to
cause objects and inherited from parent to child when new causes are
created.  Because cause objects and cause group objects exist at the
locus of every memory creation and mutation event in the SALS virtual
machine, they provide a means of tracing any event that modifies any
part of the SALS virtual machine.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:cause_group_statistics}}} shows an example of
causal reflective tracing that takes advantage of cause group objects
in order to gather run-time statistics of a fiber execution.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:hierarchical_cause_group_statistics}}} shows
another example of using a hierarchy of multiple cause group objects
in order to causally scope the tracing of $30$ parallel fibers that
are hierarchically organized into $3$ cause groups that contain $10$
fibers each.

Sometimes it is helpful to know which fiber or cause created a
specific piece of memory.  For this reason, every piece of memory in
the entire virtual machine includes a reference to its creation cause
as well as its creation fiber.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:reflective_event_causal_tracing}}} shows how a
fiber can retrieve the creation cause of a semantic event object, it
is useful to know which fiber or cause is responsible for creating a
given semantic event object so that a reflective fiber can learn from
the separate effects of different causal scopes that make
modifications to semantic objects within a given knowledge base.  This
form of causal tracing is used in the SALS cognitive architecture to
detect when one resource interacts with another resource, for example,
by activating that resource or waiting for that resource to complete
execution.  An entire reflective knowledge base of current parallel
resource interactions is maintained by tracing the causes of resource
interactions in this way.

\section{Conjunctive Hypothesis Version Space Rule-Learning}

The SALS architecture includes a ``version space''
\cite[]{mitchell:1997} hypothesis rule-learning algorithm.  A use of
this hypothesis version space rule-learning algorithm was described in
{\mbox{\autoref{chapter:learning_asynchronously_from_experience}}} as
part of a larger asynchronous learning algorithm that learns to
predict the partial state ``transframe'' \cite[]{minsky:1975} effects
of resource executions given the partial state preconditions of the
execution.  The hypothesis version space rule-learning algorithm
included in the SALS architecture predicts one binary output feature
given a number of binary input features.  The benefit of the version
space rule-learning algorithm is that it provides a relatively compact
representation of an entire conjunctive hypothesis space by only
representing the most general and most specific boundaries in the
overall lattice of potential hypotheses.  The included rule-learning
algorithm is incremental, meaning that it refines its space of
hypotheses as new examples of training data become known.  The SALS AI
hypothesis version space learning algorithm also includes ``removal
callbacks'' for most general and most specific hypotheses, so that if
these hypotheses are no longer supported given new training data,
these hooks allow tracing dependencies for correcting hypothetically
supported counterfactual knowledge in the counterfactual knowledge
base of each planning layer of the SALS AI.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:concept_version_space}}} shows how to create a
{\tt{concept\_version\_space}} object that can be trained.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:concept_version_space_training}}} shows an
example of training the {\tt{concept\_version\_space}} object, given
training examples.
{\mbox{\autoref{figure:concept_version_space_hypothetical_support}}}
shows how hypothesis removal callbacks can be used to monitor the loss
of support for a specific example, attempting to find new support
whenever the previous hypothetical support is lost.
