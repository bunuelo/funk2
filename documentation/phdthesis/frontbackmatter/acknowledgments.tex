I would be remiss if I were not to thank the following individuals,
whom have kept me sane and happy through the PhD process:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Dustin Smith for being a rock.}
\item{Grant Kristofek for loving music, staying true to the blues, and keeping my soul alive by organizing jams.}
\item{Mako Hill for helping me get Funk2 out into the public open software development communities.}
\item{Josh Lifton for inspiring me to write my first garbage collector and ultimately my own programming language.}
\item{Mat Laibowitz for disagreeing with me about almost everything, being the hardest-core engineer, and refusing ``to party''.}
\item{Mark Feldmeier for being there to ask questions, listen, and talk.}
\item{Matt Aldrich for jamming, teaching me about metal, learning technically intricate music.}
\item{Nan-Wei Gong for singing, playing keys, and generally rocking out.}
\item{Clio Andris for going through the sometimes painful PhD process with me.}
\item{Hannah Perner-Wilson for discussing the limitations of categorical thinking.}
