\noindent I would like to thank my committee:
Joe Paradiso for his belief in my ability.
Marvin Minsky for consistently providing critical perspective and important problems.
Gerry Sussman for loving to program.
Mike Cox for leading in the space of meta-cognitive science.

Greg Morgan and Carolyn Spinner for being willing to help me think about anything at any time.
Paul Bergman for teaching me how to program.
Virginia Barasch for talking about social things.

Dustin Smith for the physical social commonsense kitchen simulation.
Radu Raduta for the PID control loops for robot balance and movement.
Jon Spaulding for the EEG amplifiers and pasteless electrodes.
Gleb Kuznetsov for the first version of a 3D commonsense kitchen critic-selector layout planner.
Jing Jian for being so good at finding critical bugs in Funk2 and for writing all of the learned-reactive resources for following recipes in the kitchen.
Panupong Pasupat for the error-correcting subgraph isomorphism algorithm and the Winston difference-of-differrence analogy algorithm.
Mika Braginsky for the visualization of mental resources, agencies, and layers.

Matt Aldrich, % for jamming, teaching me about metal, learning technically intricate music.
Nan-Wei Gong, % for singing, playing keys, and generally rocking out.
Mike Lapinski, % for being a healthy athlete.
Clio Andris, % for going through the sometimes painful PhD process with me.
