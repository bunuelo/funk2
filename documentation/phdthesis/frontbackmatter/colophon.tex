\section*{Colophon}
This thesis was typeset with \LaTeXe\ using Hermann Zapf's
\emph{Palatino}
and \emph{Euler} type faces (Type~1 PostScript fonts \emph{URW
Palladio L}
and \emph{FPL} were used). The listings are typeset in \emph{Bera
Mono}, originally developed by Bitstream, Inc. as ``Bitstream Vera''.
(Type~1 PostScript fonts were made available by Malte Rosenau and
Ulrich Dirr.)

The typographic style was inspired by Bringhurst's genius as
presented in \emph{The Elements of Typographic Style} 
(Bringhurst 2002). It is available for \LaTeX\ via \textsmaller{CTAN} as 
``\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/classicthesis/}%
{\texttt{classicthesis}}''.
