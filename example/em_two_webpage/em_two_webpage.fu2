	       '<strong>Moral Compass</strong> is a free, open, cognitive architecture designed for building and correlating social commonsense reasoning models.  '
	       'Moral Compass is a computational modelling tool for the cognitive sciences.'
	       'This project is developed by the <a href=http://rct.media.mit.edu/rct>Reflective Commonsense Thinking</a> group at the <a href=http://www.media.mit.edu>MIT Media Lab</a>.'

	       '<p>Our modelling project is based on the following core goals:</p>'
	       '<ul>'
	       '  <li>informed by the latest neuroscientific models of social and moral cognition,</li>'
	       '  <li>quantitative measurements of all information and control flow for use in developing and subsequently testing scientific hypotheses,</li>'
	       '  <li>physical grounding of problem domains within deterministic physical simulation for repeatability of theoretical testing and evaluation,</li>'
	       '  <li>realistic perceptual and motor control primitives for human-like agents in commonsense situations,</li>'
	       '  <li>continuous theory development from physical problem solving that naturally bootstraps to social and moral reasoning domains,</li>'
	       '  <li>a distributed heterogenous parallal model that exhibits a layered organisational control and lateral information translation structure,</li>'
	       '  <li>evolutionary plausibility of the "glom" theory of additional hierarchical control above previously competent structures.</li>'
	       '</ul>'
	       '<p>Because the scientific process is always one of iteratively refining human knowledge, we do not see any research effort as a solution to our goals above.  '
	       'In that sense, we strive to better understand, change, and refine our goals above to better approximate healthy ways to understand human social and moral cognition by discovering and learning from strong biological underpinnings in the physical sciences.</p>  '
	       ''
	       '<h2>A Simple Overview</h2>'
	       ''
	       '<p>'
	       'So, what is a simple way to begin to talk about what we mean by "theory of mind", "social thinking", and "moral thinking"?  '
	       'In the past, these topics have spawned numerous approaches that are more or less representative of our biological understanding.  '
	       'Some approaches have been logical, others are based on semantic graph theory, while still others are based on procedural programming language definitions.  '
	       'Recently, all of these initial approaches have been extended and further researched so that we can calculate probability distributions over these representations.  '
	       'We are now at a point where we can categorize and begin to think about the diversity of human thought that these approaches allow us to describe when they are combined.  '
	       'So, what types of processes are most important to describe when we approach the extremely complicated issue of "moral reasoning"?  '
	       '</p>'
	       ''
	       '<h3>The Social Utility of Moral Reasoning</h3>'
	       ''
	       '<p>'
	       'When we think of immorality, there are many complicating factors, so how can we simplify the reality of the situation in order to create a model, which is necessarily not real, but which is still useful for predicting reality?  '
	       'Well, we currently see many approaches to studying different aspects of moral reasoning, such as how moral judgements are dependent on the causal structure of how a person understands social coersion <a href="#reference_1">[1]</a>.'
	       'We also see evidence that engaging emotions such as "pride", "embarrassment", and "regret" has been shown to be correlated to specific fMRI BOLD patterns <a href="#reference_2">[2]</a>.  '
	       'Further, lines have been drawn between mere chauvinism for one\'s own social group and the more complicating aspects of virtuous behavior that maximizes social utility <a href="#reference_3">[3]</a>.  '
	       'This gives us initial evidence and philosophical guidance to pursue better models for what we mean by virtuous behavior.  '
	       '</p>'
	       ''
	       '<h3>Current Models</h3>'
	       ''
	       '<p>'
	       'The field of machine learning has described models of goal-oriented behavior that use a numerical utility function in order to quantify whether or not a given goal has been accomplished.  '
	       'These models are proving useful for finding the beginning of an explanation for how models of the world are learned and what the function of specific neurotransmitters may be in the neocortex <a href="#reference_4">[4]</a>.  '
	       'The problem with a simple goal-oriented model is that it does not necessarily involve thinking about social relationships or goals, so we need something slightly more complicated.  '
	       'A very popular approach to thinking about the goals of multiple people involves relational representations, such as the modal logics of morality <a href="#reference_5">[5]</a>.'
	       'Combining the scientific power of goal-oriented reinforcement learning with the expressivity of relational representations is a relatively young field that is proving to be maturing very quickly <a href="#reference_6">[6]</a>.  '
	       '</p>'
	       ''
	       '<h3>The Development of Social Goals</h3>'
	       ''
	       '<p>'
	       'If we are going to develop a theory of virtuous behavior, or social goals, how do we begin to think about the cooperative and non-cooperative thought processes that would constitute working toward or against other people?  '
	       'It has been shown that the neural circuits that are involved in "theory of mind" are largely distinct from the circuits involved in perceptual capabilities <a href="#reference_7">[7]</a>.  '
	       'There have also been distinctions shown between the neural circuits involved in "theory of mind" and executive control of actions <a href="#reference_8">[8]</a>.  '
	       'While "theory of mind" can be distinguished from these aspects of basic perception and motor control, what form of virtue could a person without these capabilities exhibit?  '
	       'One answer is that we could focus exclusively on spoken and understood language.  '
	       'However, there is good reason to believe that the learning of social behavior is bootstrapped from learning causal physical models <a href="reference_9">[?]</a>.  '
	       'Let our working definition of virtuous behavior be the complexities of accomplishing and maintaining social goals, which in our model are initially learned from interactions with the physical world in the context of parents.  '
