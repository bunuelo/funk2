	       'The language is based on a peer-to-peer shared memory system, allowing individuals access to large numbers of processors and memory.'
	       'Funk2 uses a virtual scheduler, processor, and thread model that is based on top of the shared memory system, while taking advantage of the specific number of processor cores on each machine.'
	       'We use POSIX threads to implement virtual processors.'
	       'Funk2 includes very simple and abstract data and syntax representation--inspired by lisp and scheme.'
	       'Funk2 compiles to bytecodes that may be shared between architectures, inspired by these similar concepts in Python and Java virtual machines.'
	       'What is novel to the Funk2 programming language is it\'s unique ability to keep track of everything that it does, which uses a lot of memory when used indiscreetly, but in general allows reflective tracing for causal reasons why bugs occur, when they inevitably do.'
	       'Other reflective features of the language include an event-based inter-process communication system that works across the peer-to-peer network, inspired by the Erlang model.'
	       'We see a language like this as necessary for the social, iterative, cooperative design environment for large distributed complex control systems.'
