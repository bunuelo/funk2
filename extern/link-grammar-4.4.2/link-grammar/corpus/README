                Parse Ranking and Word Sense Statistics
                ---------------------------------------

This directory contains code that will compute a parse ranking, as well
as a word-sense probability (based on WordNet 3.0) by looking up
frequency statistics from an SQL database. The SQLite database engine
is by default because it is "administration-free" for the user, and
because its license is compatbile with the current link-grammar license.
