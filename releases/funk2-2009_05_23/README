1. INSTALLING FUNK2 INTO SYSTEM DIRECTORIES FOR ALL USERS

Funk2 is meant to be very easy to install and use.  It relies on only one or
two libraries that might not be installed on a typical Linux distribution.
Make sure that the gmodule development libraries are installed.  These are
a small part of the glib development package that allows loading of dynamic
libraries.  This allows Funk2 to access all of the other C libraries on the
system, including OpenGL, robotics simulations, FFTW, etc.

Once the gmodule development package is installed, you should be able to just
type the following commands to install Funk2 into system directories for all
users to have access:

  make configure
  make
  make install

Now, you should be able to use the "funk2" command from anywhere in the
system as any user.

2. COMPILING AND USING FUNK2 FROM A PRIVATE USER DIRECTORY

Installing Funk2 into system directories is not necessary for running Funk2
as a user.  It is useful to use Funk2 from a user directory if, for example,
the user does not have priveledges to modify system directories.  This is
usually the case in large grid-cluster processing situations.  In order to
compile Funk2 from a user directory, simply type the following two commands:

  make configure
  make

Now, Funk2 can be used from the compile directory by running the following
command:

  bin/funk2

Note that in order to run Funk2 from a local user directory, the bootstrap.img
file must be found in the following relative directory:

  img/bootstrap.img

 3. INSTALLING EMACS FUNK-MODE

 In order to install the emacs major mode for editing Funk2 files
 (*.fu2), copy the funk-mode.el file to your user's home directory
 (/home/username/), like this:

   cp funk-mode.el /home/username/

 Now, you'll need to add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:

   (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/username/")
   (autoload 'funk-mode "funk-mode" "Funk Mode." t)
   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.funk\\'" . funk-mode))
   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.fu\\'" . funk-mode))
   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.fu2\\'" . funk-mode))
   (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("funk" . funk-mode))

 That should allow you to use [Meta-X, funk-mode] in order to load the
 Funk2 major editing mode.  Now, in order to enable syntax
 highlighting for *.fu2 files automatically, add the following line to
 your .emacs file as well:

   (global-font-lock-mode t)
