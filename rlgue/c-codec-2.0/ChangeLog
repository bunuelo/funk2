RL-GLUE C-Codec RC2 :: 2008-10-11  
-----------------------------------------
2008-10-11  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r337] configure, configure.ac,
	  examples/custom_integrated_env/src/Custom_Integrated_Env_Codec.c,
	  examples/skeleton_agent/SkeletonAgent.c,
	  examples/skeleton_environment/SkeletonEnvironment.c,
	  examples/skeleton_experiment/SkeletonExperiment.c,
	  src/RL_client_agent.c, src/RL_client_environment.c,
	  src/RL_client_experiment.c, src/RL_debug.c, tests/test_1_agent.c,
	  tests/test_1_environment.c, tests/test_1_experiment.c,

	  tests/test_seeds_experiment.c, tests/test_speed_environment.c,
	  tests/test_speed_experiment.c, tests/useful_functions.c: Merged
	  the C-Const pointer branch with the trunk. The RL-Glue C Codec is
	  now compatible with the pointer version of RL-Glue 3.x.

2008-10-09  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r327] src/RL_client_agent.c, src/RL_client_environment.c,
	  src/RL_client_experiment.c: Updated the gethostbyname stuff to
	  die gracefully if can't lookup the hostname.

	* [r326] Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config/config.h.in,
	  config/ltmain.sh, configure, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/RL_client_agent.c, src/RL_client_environment.c,
	  src/RL_client_experiment.c, tests/Makefile.in: Updated the C
	  codec main() functions to use a more current approach to
	  translate host names to host addresses, this should fix a compile
	  error on GCC 4.3.

	* [r325] configure.ac: Moved AC_PROG_CC/INSTALL/LIBTOOL to top of
	  configure.ac which fixes a weird bug that only shows up when
	  doing an if statement. In the process, fixed a weird bug in the
	  conditional library check. We also check for a few more functions
	  now, and for some structs.

2008-10-08  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r323] Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config/config.h.in,

	  codecs compile and link right in Cygwin.

	* [r322] tests/pkill.sh, tests/test_1.sh, tests/test_empty.sh,
	  tests/test_message.sh, tests/test_rl_episode.sh,
	  tests/test_sanity.sh, tests/test_seeds.sh, tests/test_speed.sh:
	  took out pkill because its a kludge, went back to killall, but
	  redirect stderr to dev null so we don't get ugly warnings. can't
	  just use -q because BSD doesn't support it.

	* [r321] tests/test_1.sh, tests/test_empty.sh,
	  tests/test_message.sh, tests/test_rl_episode.sh,
	  tests/test_sanity.sh, tests/test_seeds.sh, tests/test_speed.sh:
	  Updated all of the tests to use pkill script instead of killall,
	  because killall works the way I Want only on Mac, pkill works on
	  Mac and Linux.

	* [r320] tests/pkill.sh: A little utility script that lets you kill
	  processes by name.:

	* [r319] tests/test_rl_episode_experiment.c: Removed an unused
	  variable.

	  tests/test_seeds_experiment.c, tests/useful_functions.c: Move to
	  using config.h for configuration, fixed make distcheck by putting
	  the test scripts into EXTRA_DIST, got the SVN version into
	  SVN_VERSION symbol using same trick as in RL-Glue, and now print
	  that out when we start up an agent/env/exp.

	  the codec will compile with the new RL-Glue types.
