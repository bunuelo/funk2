## Goals

Our goal with this lab is to make you familiar and confident with using tools from different sub-fields in artificial intelligence so that you can think concretely about how they should work together in an autonomous problem solving agent.

In this first laboratory, you will learn about ways to represent, learn and use knowledge to solve problems.   We will present the problems within complete problem solving frameworks, beginning with the very simplest.

# Problem 1 (Ch 1)

In some situations emotions can be useful ways of thinking, while in others
these same ways of thinking can be detrimental.  For example, if one sees
their child walking near a cliff, becoming Anxious is a very relevant
response that hones the senses and primes fast motor reactions.  However,
in the context of taking a test, some people feel Test Anxiety, a related
mental state, where these same effects make it difficult for complex ways of
thinking to operate without being distracted by these same "fight or
flight" reactions.

 **a)** Pick three emotions and describe their characteristics, as turning on
    or off resources.

 **b)** Using these same emotions, describe situations where these emotions
    and their characteristics would be helpful.  Describe situations where
    these characteristics would be detrimental.


# Problem 2 (Ch 2)

Regarding Remembering, Minsky explains that "On the surface, it might seem
easy enough--like dropping a note into a box and then taking it out when
you need it.  But when we look more closely, we see that this must involve
many processes: you first must decide what items your note should contain,
and find suitable ways to represent them--and then you must make some
connections to them so that after you store those parts away, you'll be
able to reassemble them."

What are examples of the types of items your note should contain?
For example, you might need to later recall prerequisites for a
successful action toward a goal.  Try to think of three types
of knowledge related to mental events as well as three related to external
events.

# Problem 3 (Ch 3)

Minsky: "What makes feelings so hard to describe? Is this because feelings are
so simple and basic that there's nothing more to be said about them?  No, its 
precisely the opposite, because...what we call feelings are the results of 
attempts (by some parts of one's mind) to describe entire mental conditions.
However, every mental state is so complex that any brief description of it 
could capture just a few aspects of it." (Ch 3)

 **a)** How does this imply a limitation on our introspective abilities?

 **b)** How does this relate to using abstract or ambiguous terminology (\eg "suitcase words")?


# Problem 4 (Ch 3)

In 3-8, Minsky discusses emotional exploitation as a method of self-control.
Describe some memories you could conjure to indirectly cause reactions and 
resolve one of these goal conflicts. 

 **example)** You want to study for a test, and you are tired.  
   Conjure a memory of failing the test to elicit a Fearful state, or
   Imagine a competition between another colleague to obtain Anger.

 **a)** You are on a diet, and want to eat Double Fudge ice cream.

 **b)** You want a good grade, and you are bored in class.

 **c)** You want to yell at a police officer, and not be arrested.


# Problem 5 (Ch 4)

Regarding the word Consciousness, Minsky states, "I'll argue that it would
be a mistake to believe in any such entity--because we ought to be asking
this question, instead: "Isn't it remarkable that any single word or phrase
could have come to mean so many different things?"

Think of when the term "consciousness" is used, and unpack (list) some of the different ideas that we talk about
when we use the word.

# Problem 6 (Ch 5)

Specify the four critics (corrector, suppressor, censor and encourager [p86])
in this story:

"Joan is applying for a job at two AI companies, 'Intelligence Vacuum' and 
'Emergent Design', and begins to write applications. In her first email, she 
discusses her credentials, education and a question about her salary.  After 
she sends the email, she reflects and concludes that it was premature to 
discuss financial issues.  Joan begins her next email, this time she only 
includes education and her credentials.  In the credentials section, she 
sees a great opportunity for a joke and lists her programming skills, "LISP,
C and SNOBOL," under the title 'Foreign Languages.' Impressed with her humor,
she thinks about inserting an emoticon ':-)' but does not. Ending her email, 
she misspells her name and then quickly corrects it before sending."
