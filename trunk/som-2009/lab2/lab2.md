# Remembering #


Regarding Remembering, Minsky explains that "On the surface, it might seem
easy enough--like dropping a note into a box and then taking it out when
you need it.  But when we look more closely, we see that this must involve
many processes: you first must decide what items your note should contain,
and find suitable ways to represent them--and then you must make some
connections to them so that after you store those parts away, you'll be
able to reassemble them."

\question

What are examples of the types of items your 'note' should contain? 
For example, you might need to later recall prerequisites for a
successful action toward a goal.  List some other kinds of meta knowledge.

# Emotional Exploitation

\question In 3-8, Minsky discusses emotional exploitation as a method of self-control. Describe some memories you could conjure to indirectly cause reactions and 
resolve one of these goal conflicts. 

 **example)** You want to study for a test, and you are tired.  Conjure a memory of failing the test to elicit a Fearful state or Imagine a competition between another colleague to obtain Anger, thereby releasing adrenaline to suppress Sleep.

 **a)** You are on a diet, and want to eat Double Fudge ice cream.

 **b)** You want a good grade, and you are bored in class.

 **c)** You want to yell at a police officer, and not be arrested.


# Unpacking Selves #


Regarding the word Consciousness, Minsky states, "I'll argue that it would
be a mistake to believe in any such entity--because we ought to be asking
this question, instead: "Isn't it remarkable that any single word or phrase
could have come to mean so many different things?"  

\question In 4-2, Minsky unpacks the suitcase word 'consciousness'.  Think of when the term "self" is used, and unpack (list) some of the different ideas that we talk about when we use the word.

# Corrector, Suppressors, Censors and Encouragers

\question Label the four types of critics (corrector, suppressor, censor and encourager [p86]) in this story:

Joan is applying for a job at two AI companies, 'Intelligence Vacuum' and 
'Emergent Design', and begins to write applications. In her first email, she 
discusses her credentials, education and a question about her salary.  After 
she sends the email, she reflects and concludes that it was premature to 
discuss financial issues **(1)**.  Joan begins her next email, this time she only 
includes education and her credentials.  In the credentials section, she 
sees a great opportunity for a joke and lists her programming skills, "LISP,
C and SNOBOL," under the title 'Foreign Languages' **(2)**. Impressed with her humor,
she thinks about inserting an emoticon ':-)' but does not **(3)**. Ending her email, 
she misspells her name and then quickly corrects it before sending **(4)**.


# Three part rules #


In the section on Learned Reactions, Minsky describes how IF->DO rule
alone are not enough because there are always exceptions for each rule, 
which would make the assertion false. 

\question What benefits does adding 'THEN' to IF->DO rules provide?


# Knowledge in Context #


People communicate efficiently by assuming shared context and background world knowledge to compress the verbal messages we impart. Take for example the commonsense assertion: “females have long hair.” A lot of details are left implicit: 

  - **Females:** What kind of females? Zebras, ducks and boats? No, human females.  Babies? No, adult human females. At MIT? In Soviet Russia? 
  - **Hair:** Facial hair? Underarm hair? No, hair on their heads!  
  - **Long:** How long is long? Longer than what? Presumably, the hair on the heads of adult male humans. 

One problem with this sentence is that it is *under-speciﬁed*; the sentence assumes 
a shared-context to parse its intended meaning. If we fully expanded the context, we would have something like "adult female humans have longer hair on their heads than adult male humans in America on planet Earth in the later 20th century." 

\question Pick five assertions from the first 500 entires in OMCS and expand the context in a similar way as the above example.    \url{http://web.media.mit.edu/~dustin/6.868/omcs-h500.txt}.



# Model-6 critic-selectors

On pg. 229-230, Minsky lists examples of critics and selectors for
the top 4 layers (deliberative, reflective, self-reflective, and
self-conscious).  For example, in the deliberative layer, "An
action did not achieve the expected effect" is a critic, while
"Find a better way to predict" is a selector that this critic
activates.

\question For each of these four layers, list two additional critic-selector pairs.
